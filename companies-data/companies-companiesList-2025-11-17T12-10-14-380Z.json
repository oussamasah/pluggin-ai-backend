        "description": "Some journeys stay with you for a long time ✨ \n\nA while back, I had one of those defining moments at Alaan الآن — when Parthi Duraisamy and Karun Kurien trusted me to lead the redesign of our Mobile App. \n\nWhat started as a conversation quickly turned into a mission: this app had to go from functional → world-class. 🌎 \n\nThe old app worked, yes. But it lacked delight, consistency, and scalability. We wanted more than just utility, we wanted an experience users would be proud to use and share. \n\nSo,\n- We built a design language that could grow with us,\n- Reimagined flows to feel effortless\n- And obsessed over every tiny detail to make the experience truly seamless.\n\nIt wasn’t easy. It took countless iterations, user feedback loops, and an obsession with pixel-perfect execution. But it was worth it.\n\nNow, as this blog which is more of a reflection, goes live, I’m reminded of why I love building and designing products. Not just to solve problems, but to create experiences that inspire trust and bring joy.\n\nHere’s the full story of how we reimagined the Alaan mobile app: 🚀 \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g5fs8Vhk\n\n\n#uxdesign #uiuxdesign #productdesign #uirevamp #uiuxrevamp #mobileapprevamp #alaan #fintech #designblog",

        "description": "Alaan الآن, the UAE-based spend management platform for businesses, has secured US$48 million in a heavily oversubscribed Series A round, billed as one of the largest in the region’s history.\n\nThe raise was led by venture capital (VC) and growth investing firm Peak XV Partners, with significant participation from 885 Capital founders Sudeep R. and Jai Mahtani, Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator Y Combinator, Berlin-based tech investment firm 468 Capital, and San Francisco-based VC firm Pioneer Fund. \n\nThe round included both primary and secondary funding, and it attracted a host of prominent regional and global operators. Notable backers include Tabby co-founder and CEO Hosam Arab, Careem co-founder and CEO Mudassir Sheikha, Pleo co-founder and CEO Jeppe Rindom, KAM founder Khalid Al Ameri, Astra Tech founder Abdallah Abu-Sheikh, talabat Chief Product Officer Yi-Wei Ang, and Aspora founder Parth Garg, among others.\n \nFounded by former McKinsey consultants Parthi Duraisamy and Karun Kurien in the UAE in 2022, Alaan is a comprehensive spend management platform that, to date, has processed 2.5 million transactions for over 1,500 startup, mid-market, and enterprise clients—including G42, Careem, Tabby, Lulu Group, and Rivoli—across industries such as real estate, aviation, logistics, and retail. In an interview with Inc. Arabia, Duraisamy, who also serves as the CEO of Alaan, reflected on the scale of the company’s latest raise and the factors that drove investor confidence in the company. \n\n“I think it comes down to two things: timing and trust,\" Duraisamy said. \"The Middle East—especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE—is going through a generational shift in how businesses operate and adopt technology. Investors are eager to back companies that are building for this shift, and Alaan is right at the center of it.”\n\nCheck out our full interview with Duraisamy here: https://lnkd.in/e_7MYKjg \n\n#entrepreneurs #startups #UAE #KSA #fintech #spendmanagement #GCC #MiddleEast #MENA #SaudiArabia #investment #funding #innovation #AI #artificialintelligence #tech #business #leaders #growth #expansion",

The one who started it all.\n\nDubai, 2017. I packed my life into a suitcase and landed in a city where I didn’t know a single person. The job was fast-paced, high-pressure, and the learning curve was vertical. Some days I thrived. Other days, I survived. \n\nAnd then, one afternoon, not during a big win, not after a career milestone, but during something as ordinary as selling my first car, it hit me how far I had come.\n\nRead the full blog here - https://lnkd.in/dnJ_9Vxq",

It was thoughtful, challenging and blunt; our mobile app while functional wasn’t a joy to use. He was watching from the balcony and he was right.\n\nI didn’t act on it immediately. This required an entire revamp of what we had built. There were fires to fight and deadlines to hit. But the memo stayed with me.\n\nToday, the new Alaan mobile app is live. It’s the result of quiet, consistent work across product, design, and engineering - not just to make it look better, but to make it feel better. Every decision was intentional. Every moment in the experience was rethought.\n\nProud of the team that pushed this through in the middle of 101 other things while navigating incessant feedback, constraints, and shifting priorities. Harsh Choudhary, Sanjana Dhakad on design, Rahul Behera, Tushar Ghige on engineering, Parthi Duraisamy for spending time on the balcony and helping a great deal.\n\nWe're proud of what we’re putting into people’s hands. Hope it feels lighter, clearer and more intuitive.\n\nThe new Alaan mobile app.",
