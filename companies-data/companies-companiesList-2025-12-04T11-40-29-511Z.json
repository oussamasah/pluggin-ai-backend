Poon has nearly a decade of legal experience and was previously litigation counsel at Akin Gump and before that was a corporate associate at Simpson Thacher.\nWe talked about how important good metadata is for search – that hasn’t changed in a generative AI world – and how having data semantically indexed can trigger further workflows.\n\nPoon gave a demo of the AI profiling tool, which enables firms to apply a consistent taxonomy across their document set. With the editing tool, you can then apply global edits at scale.\n\nWe discussed best practices and challenges around creating a taxonomy, and the types of workflows that can be triggered when all the relevant profile attributes are filled out, for example triggering a review process for a lease agreement after a period of time.\n\nWe also chatted with listeners on a range of topics, including how to manage a situation where some clients don’t allow their firm to use generative AI.\n\nTo listen to the webinar click HERE 🔗 https://lnkd.in/gsRVYWGg\n\n#legaltech #AI #GenerativeAI #NetDocuments #webinar",
