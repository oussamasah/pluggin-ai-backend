        "description": "Ideas are completely overrated. They’re rarely right.\n\nWhat actually matters is the problem and the number of reps you get talking to customers and building for those problems.  In those reps, ideas evolve fast.  They turn into insights, and those insights turn into the real solutions.\n\nThe “idea fallacy” assumes your very first thought is correct and won’t change.  But that’s never how anything great gets built.\n\nWhen I got into commerce, I focused on one core problem: merchants needed better software to start and scale their businesses.  This was before anyone had built in the Shopify ecosystem. So I focused there and within a year, I launched seven different Shopify apps tackling different angles of that problem.\n\nEventually, I landed on subscriptions. And honestly, I thought it was a terrible idea at the time. “Subscribe & save” had just launched, and the idea that people would pay shipping for small consumables instead of going to the store sounded crazy.\n\nBut I wasn’t married to the idea, I was committed to solving the problem.  So I built it out in a month just to see if it worked.\n\nThat mindset, not being attached to any one idea, gave me the freedom to keep iterating until I found the thing that hit.",

Are your loyal customers feeling left out during big sales?\n\nKendall Singer Cook from Arrae shares a genius solution → Offer existing subscribers bonus credits for purchases during Black Friday/Cyber Monday.\n\nHere’s why it works:\n ✅ Rewards long-term customers\n ✅ Prevents churn from “offer gamification”\n ✅ Keeps spending inside your ecosystem\n\nBy leveraging Recharge’s credit system, Arrae found a cost-effective way to drive sales and strengthen retention - a win-win for both customers and the brand.\n\nThe smartest brands focus on locking in longer-term subscribers rather than relying on deep, one-time discounts.\n\nWhen you reward loyalty and emphasize subscription value year-round, sustainable growth follows.\n\n💡 What are you doing this season to keep your subscribers feeling valued?",

        "description": "Ideas are completely overrated. They’re rarely right.\n\nWhat actually matters is the problem and the number of reps you get talking to customers and building for those problems.  In those reps, ideas evolve fast.  They turn into insights, and those insights turn into the real solutions.\n\nThe “idea fallacy” assumes your very first thought is correct and won’t change.  But that’s never how anything great gets built.\n\nWhen I got into commerce, I focused on one core problem: merchants needed better software to start and scale their businesses.  This was before anyone had built in the Shopify ecosystem. So I focused there and within a year, I launched seven different Shopify apps tackling different angles of that problem.\n\nEventually, I landed on subscriptions. And honestly, I thought it was a terrible idea at the time. “Subscribe & save” had just launched, and the idea that people would pay shipping for small consumables instead of going to the store sounded crazy.\n\nBut I wasn’t married to the idea, I was committed to solving the problem.  So I built it out in a month just to see if it worked.\n\nThat mindset, not being attached to any one idea, gave me the freedom to keep iterating until I found the thing that hit.",

It was an intentionally curated experience designed to create space—space to connect, to collaborate, and most importantly, to listen.\n\nWe were thrilled to have Miyishia Slay from Shopify join us as a special guest to open the afternoon. Her perspective and facilitation helped shape the tone for the day by encouraging deeper dialogue around the customer journey, the challenges brands are facing in today’s climate, and what it truly takes to scale with purpose.\n\nTogether, we explored:\n🧠 The end-to-end customer journey—what’s working, what’s not, and where brands are doubling down\n🧭 How to navigate uncertainty while scaling sustainably\n🔁 Where and how the best operators are iterating and pivoting in real time\n💡 The opportunities Recharge has to learn directly from our brands and co-build better solutions\n\nThe feedback, vulnerability, and honesty shared in the room were a powerful reminder that community is a catalyst.\n\nWhen we create spaces like this, we spark ideas, surface patterns, and fuel better product decisions together.\n\nWe’re just getting started, and we can’t wait to take this roadshow to more cities.

        "description": "Consumer behavior is evolving faster than I’ve ever seen, and brands need to keep up\n\n1. Consumers are discovering products on TikTok and Instagram\n\n2. They’re asking ChatGPT for product comparisons\n\n3. They’re repurchasing only the items that pass the test\n\nThis isn’t just a channel shift, but a customer mindset shift. \n\nBrands need to deliver simple, intuitive experiences where and when customers need them most. \n\nSo we thought, what if managing a subscription could be as easy as texting a friend? \n\nAnd what if the tool on the other end actually knew your customer, like their preferences, history, and intent?\n\nThat’s why we built Concierge SMS. \n\nNot as another feature, but as a reimagination of the customer experience itself: proactive, conversational, and built on AI. \n\nWith Concierge SMS, brands are delivering:\n\n☑️ AI-powered messages at key moments\n\n☑️ Predictive communication based on real behavior\n\n☑️ Seamlessness without logins or apps\n\nEarly adopters like Lashify are already seeing the difference: simpler subscription management is leading to happier customers and far less friction. Since implementing Concierge SMS, they haven’t looked back.\n\nThis isn’t just a new interface—it’s the new customer expectation\n\nIf you’re thinking about how to future-proof your customer journey in an AI-first world, I’m all ears. And if you’d like to join the Concierge SMS waitlist, drop a comment.",
