The result? Luxurious business-class flights and stays at five-star hotels became a reality.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that these points aren't just an added bonus; they represent pre-paid travel opportunities that can either be utilized or foregone.\n\nSo, the critical question arises: Are your business expenses merely generating more receipts, or are they strategically acquiring frequent flier miles for your benefit",

We got the opportunity to show the world what an amazing and modern solution Qashio for Travel is at our launch event at the Royal Atlantis Spa & Resort and to establish our presence at Arabian Travel Market with one of the most visited stands of the whole exhibition.\n\nWhen we started the project in 2022 together with Visa we had a vision to build UAE's first Business Loyalty program and Travel solution for Travel companies as the industry even though massive was severely underserved. We spent years doing research and development, looking at international standards while localizing the solution to serve the needs of the local players in UAE and KSA.  \n\nThe result: \n- Fast growing Loyalty Program with soon more than 10 top tier Airline & Hotel Partners\n- Multicurrency cards (AED, SAR, USD, EUR, GBP) for the travel industry to save money on international transfers\n- High Cashbacks, Rebates and Ultralow FX fee's to support the growing need for cashflow\n\nIt's been an honor to work alongside every single Qashio team member involved in taking the vision to reality and to top it of, the greatest honor and validation of all was for the greatest modern visionary HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum to stop by our stand. \n\nWe look forward to serve and be part of the growth of the Travel Industry in UAE and GCC",

This commission is determined by the Merchant Category Code (MCC), which is a percentage of the transaction value determined by the category the merchant belongs to.\n\nFor instance, Deliveroo is rightfully categorized as a restaurant, while Talabat is classified as a grocery company despite primarily focusing on aggregating restaurant deliveries and claiming they are a technology company on their Linkedin page. Similarly, Noon, markets itself as an E-commerce or Retail entity (according to their Linkedin page in UAE & KSA) while their MCC carries a grocery status. These companies collaborate with payment gateways to lower fees, resulting in reduced rewards for their customers like miles and cashbacks on credit cards used.\n\nThis practice extends beyond just these examples. To optimize spending and maximize rewards, it's crucial to choose vendors wisely.\n\nBoth Noon & Talabat are otherwise great services and great companies with fantastic individuals leading the organizations employing some of the best talent in the country. I would have used them much more frequently if I would have earned the same rewards on my credit cards as I do when using Deliveroo and Amazon since the cost to me remains the same. \n\nAt Qashio, our Customer Success Management team proactively assists clients in selecting the right vendors to maximize cashbacks, miles, and other rewards without incurring additional costs. We work in alignment with our clients objectives to enhance payment efficiency, minimize expenses and risks, and ensure the highest returns on all expenditures through a unified platform. \n\nLearn more and book a demo https://lnkd.in/dMX6Qguk",

They are a full-fledged corporate service provider that has helped over 100,000 businesses and entrepreneurs set up in mainland, free zones, or secure Golden Visas.\n\nBehind the scenes, managing shared cards from multiple banks was slowing them down. With multiple shared cards across PRO, admin, and marketing teams, it was all too easy for receipts to slip away, OTPs to get delayed, and reconciliation to feel like a full-time job.\n\nThat changed when they switched to Alaan. Today, every team has its own Alaan card with category-based controls, real-time tracking, and 2% cashback on international spend.\n\nThis is how Shuraa brought its internal ops up to the same gold standard it delivers to clients.\n\nBig thanks to Deep Sachdev for taking us behind the scenes at Shuraa.\n\nFull story 👉🏼  https://lnkd.in/eMfieApc",

But it lacked delight, consistency, and scalability. We wanted more than just utility, we wanted an experience users would be proud to use and share. \n\nSo,\n- We built a design language that could grow with us,\n- Reimagined flows to feel effortless\n- And obsessed over every tiny detail to make the experience truly seamless.\n\nIt wasn’t easy. It took countless iterations, user feedback loops, and an obsession with pixel-perfect execution. But it was worth it.\n\nNow, as this blog which is more of a reflection, goes live, I’m reminded of why I love building and designing products. Not just to solve problems, but to create experiences that inspire trust and bring joy.\n\nHere’s the full story of how we reimagined the Alaan mobile app: 🚀 \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g5fs8Vhk\n\n\n#uxdesign #uiuxdesign #productdesign #uirevamp #uiuxrevamp #mobileapprevamp #alaan #fintech #designblog",

Notable backers include Tabby co-founder and CEO Hosam Arab, Careem co-founder and CEO Mudassir Sheikha, Pleo co-founder and CEO Jeppe Rindom, KAM founder Khalid Al Ameri, Astra Tech founder Abdallah Abu-Sheikh, talabat Chief Product Officer Yi-Wei Ang, and Aspora founder Parth Garg, among others.\n \nFounded by former McKinsey consultants Parthi Duraisamy and Karun Kurien in the UAE in 2022, Alaan is a comprehensive spend management platform that, to date, has processed 2.5 million transactions for over 1,500 startup, mid-market, and enterprise clients—including G42, Careem, Tabby, Lulu Group, and Rivoli—across industries such as real estate, aviation, logistics, and retail. In an interview with Inc. Arabia, Duraisamy, who also serves as the CEO of Alaan, reflected on the scale of the company’s latest raise and the factors that drove investor confidence in the company. \n\n“I think it comes down to two things: timing and trust,\" Duraisamy said. \"The Middle East—especially Saudi Arabia and the UAE—is going through a generational shift in how businesses operate and adopt technology. Investors are eager to back companies that are building for this shift, and Alaan is right at the center of it.”\n\nCheck out our full interview with Duraisamy here: https://lnkd.in/e_7MYKjg \n\n#entrepreneurs #startups #UAE #KSA #fintech #spendmanagement #GCC #MiddleEast #MENA #SaudiArabia #investment #funding #innovation #AI #artificialintelligence #tech #business #leaders #growth #expansion",

She’s the kind of finance leader who thrives without a playbook, building from the ground up and scaling across markets without missing a beat.\n\nHere are a few highlights from our chat where she shared:\n- Why great finance hires aren’t just technically strong, they’re curious and ask “why?”.\n- How finance can stop being a bottleneck by embedding systems into day-to-day decisions.\n- How the CFO role isn’t just about reporting, it’s about direction, sustainability, and strategic perspective.\n\nYou can catch the full interview here 👇🏼 \nhttps://lnkd.in/gCEkmSG8 \n\nAbout Maheen Wahid:\nShe is the CFO at Squadio | سكواديو. With 12+ years of experience across MENA’s tech scene, she’s built finance functions from zero, restructured pricing engines, and led investor-backed growth at companies like Wadi.com, Shipa Delivery, and now Squadio. An ACCA and data science graduate, she leads with sharp thinking, grounded execution, and a deep belief that finance should enable vision, not just report on it.\n\nKnow more about our community: https://lnkd.in/eNvgsjRw",

It was thoughtful, challenging and blunt; our mobile app while functional wasn’t a joy to use. He was watching from the balcony and he was right.\n\nI didn’t act on it immediately. This required an entire revamp of what we had built. There were fires to fight and deadlines to hit. But the memo stayed with me.\n\nToday, the new Alaan mobile app is live. It’s the result of quiet, consistent work across product, design, and engineering - not just to make it look better, but to make it feel better. Every decision was intentional. Every moment in the experience was rethought.\n\nProud of the team that pushed this through in the middle of 101 other things while navigating incessant feedback, constraints, and shifting priorities. Harsh Choudhary, Sanjana Dhakad on design, Rahul Behera, Tushar Ghige on engineering, Parthi Duraisamy for spending time on the balcony and helping a great deal.\n\nWe're proud of what we’re putting into people’s hands.

Is there a clear path to advance?\n\n3) Salary & Benefits Package – Beyond the base salary, look at bonuses, health benefits, and time off! Do the perks meet your needs?\n\n4) Company Culture – Do the company’s values align with yours? Research their social media or ask current employees for insights.\n\n5) Work-Life Balance – Check for flexible hours and remote options.
