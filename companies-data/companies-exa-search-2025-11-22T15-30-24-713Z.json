Engineers and manufacturers are leveraging industrial CT to accelerate decision-making and time-to-market while also saving millions of dollars on destructive testing, prototyping, and potential recalls.\n\n[How does it work?](https://www.lumafield.com/article/what-is-industrial-ct)\n\n[**Scanner**\\\n\\\n**Neptune** \\\n\\\n**Neptune — Lab CT Scanner**](https://www.lumafield.com/www.lumafield.com#neptune) [**Scanner**\\\n\\\n**Triton** \\\n\\\n****Triton** — Factory CT Scanner**](https://www.lumafield.com/www.lumafield.com#triton) [**Software**\\\n\\\n**Voyager** \\\n\\\n**Voyager — Cloud-based analysis software**](https://www.lumafield.com/www.lumafield.com#voyager)\n\n## Accelerate product development\n\n## Neptune\n\n### Lab ct scanner\n\nSave time by catching and fixing flaws at the outset.

Neustark’s carbon removal (CDR) is permanent, verified, and measurable.\n\n[Let's take climate action together!](https://www.neustark.com/en/businesses-with-climate-targets)\n\n## The process\n\n## Why we do it\n\nBy removing CO2from the atmosphere and storing it in demolition concrete permanently, neustark's technology generates negative emissions.\n\nReducing the emissions we produce across the globe is crucial – but to reach our climate goals, carbon removal is also indispensable.\n\nFor a bright future of all generations on our planet.\n\n[Why carbon removal is important](https://www.neustark.com/en/our-mission-negative-emissions-for-net-zero)\n\n## How we do it\n\nNeustark captures, transports and stores CO2 by working with source (e.g. biogas plants) and storage (i.e. concrete recyclers) partners located in close proximity to each other.\n\nOur mineralization technology binds the CO2 in demolished concrete, thus removing it permanently.\n\nBusinesses at the forefront of climate action buy our CDR, which, alongside their reduction efforts, helps them to achieve net-zero.\n\nIt’s a win-win-win for our partners and clients, and ultimately and most importantly, the planet and all generations.\n\n[This is how it works](https://www.neustark.com/en/our-solution-mineralization)\n\n> **We enable permanent CO2 storage** – for a bright future of all generations on our planet.\n\n## Our network of trusted partners, clients, and organizations\n\n## Latest news\n\nBlog\n\n03.09.25\n12 min read\n\n### London’s iconic Skyline could be the secret formula to unlock Construction’s circular economy in the UK\n\nUsing the world’s largest waste stream - demolition concrete - as a carbon sink offers a transformative solution to lock away residual CO2 within new buildings.\n\nFind out more\n\nPress release\n\n26.08.25\n7 min read\n\n### Neustark and Swiss sign multi-year carbon removal agreement\n\nSWISS becomes neustark’s first CDR partner from the aviation industry.\n\nFind out more\n\nCase Studies\n\n13.08.25\n9 min read\n\n### Practical application in Berlin shows: carbonated recycled concrete is in no way inferior to conventional concrete\n\nThe Friedenauer Höhe is the first large residential construction project where carbonated recycled concrete has been used.\n\nFind out more\n\n## Interested in connecting with us at neustark?\n\n[Contact us today](https://www.neustark.com/en/get-in-touch)",

Next to substantially reducing emissions, this target will only be possible by globally deploying carbon removal (CDR) solutions at the scale of billions of tons of CO2. Neustark is a leading provider in this rapidly growing field, having developed a solution to permanently store CO2 from the air in recycled mineral waste such as demolished concrete. \n\nOur first solutions have been deployed in Switzerland and Europe and are already capturing and storing tons of CO2 every week. We are currently scaling up our operations and carbon removal impact globally – on the road to removing one million tons of CO2 in 2030, and beyond that. \n\nFounded in 2019, neustark AG is based in Berne, Switzerland, and is a team of around 55 people (as per Q3 2023) working at our Berne, Zurich and Cologne offices. Together, we enable permanent CO2 storage for a bright future of all generations on our planet.\n\nWhat we do in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joVBNV9O2MA",
