Historically, Amrop has been active in the Middle East as a retained Executive Search provider since 1997. Today, Amrop Saudi Arabia is recognized as one of the leading Executive Search firms in Saudi Arabia focusing on Executive Search placements for Senior Leadership and C-Suite roles across all corporate functions. We also offer other complimentary services to enable our clients to build more effective leadership structures and teams such as Leadership Advisory services and Board Consulting services.\n\nAt Amrop Saudi Arabia, we believe in establishing long-lasting partnerships with our clients and not just transactional relationships. This approach allowed us to become Trusted Advisors to CEOs, Boards and decision makers across the Private, Public and Non-Profit sectors of Saudi Arabia. We have successfully served clients across various industries, namely: Aerospace & Defense, Financial Services, FMCG, Healthcare and Life Sciences, Logistics, Transportation & Supply Chain, Hospitality & Tourism, Petrochemicals & Industrial Manufacturing, Real Estate Development & Construction, Retail, and Professional Services.\n\nWe follow a Context-Driven methodology to assure the success of every project that ultimately enables our clients to successfully execute their strategies and achieve their business objectives. We begin by investing quality time to understand our client’s business and the role in question. Based on our understanding, we design a unique Search Strategy that is meticulously crafted for each search assignment. As we are based in Saudi Arabia, we bring an extensive local network of contacts and knowledge of the Saudi market into every assignment. Additionally, when the need arises, we work seamlessly with other global Amrop offices to achieve a greater geographic reach in sourcing candidates and/or leveraging their industry expertise and network of contacts\n\nFurthermore, our approach extends far beyond our database. In every Executive Search assignment, we conduct rigorous and targeted research to identify relevant candidates in the market. Once identified, we conduct thorough assessments to determine a technical and cultural fit; this process enables us to confidently offer our clients a 12-month warranty.\n\nIn addition to retained Executive Search, we offer Leadership Assessments, Leadership & Team Development, Onboarding and Executive Coaching, as well as Board Advisory services such as Amrop’s proprietary Board Evaluation Tool (BET ©), among other board consulting services.\n\n\\-\\-\\----------------------------------\n\nWe recognize that our role in protecting personal data is critical – on behalf of our clients, our candidates and Amrop’s executive search professionals. We are committed to ensuring that all personal data shared and processed within Amrop is protected, private and secure.\n\nRead about Amrop’s approach to data protection [here](https://www.amrop.com/our-approach/privacy-data-protection/).\n\n[![Mansour Abdulghaffar](https://www.amrop.com/media/exwms0ca/mansour-abdulghaffar.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=30&height=30&format=auto&quality=30&rnd=132842125675030000)](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/find-a-consultant/profile/mansour-abdulghaffar)\n\nMansour Abdulghaffar\n\nManaging Partner\n\n[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/global-offices/Jeddah)\n\nP: [+966 12 261 3172](tel:+966 12 261 3172)\n\nConsumer & Retail, Financial Services, Government & Public Sector, Hospitality & Food Service, Industrial, Life Sciences, Not-For-Profit, Professional Services, Property & Real Estate, Transportation Shipping & Logistics, Travel & Tourism\n\n[![Farah Abdul Rehman](https://www.amrop.com/media/suzhzax5/farah-abdul-rehman.jpg?center=0.38809182209469151,0.49569583931133426&mode=crop&width=30&height=30&format=auto&quality=30&rnd=133185074765130000)](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/find-a-consultant/profile/farah-abdul-rehman)\n\nFarah Abdul Rehman\n\nClient Partner\n\n[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/global-offices/Jeddah)\n\nFinancial Services, Property & Real Estate, Consumer & Retail, Life Sciences, Energy & Infrastructure\n\n[![Lativia Abduljawad](https://www.amrop.com/media/3nzne0gx/lativia-abduljawad.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=30&height=30&format=auto&quality=30&rnd=132842126802530000)](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/find-a-consultant/profile/lativia-abduljawad)\n\nLativia Abduljawad\n\nConsultant\n\n[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/global-offices/Jeddah)\n\nConsumer & Retail, Government & Public Sector, Industrial, Transportation Shipping & Logistics\n\n[![Sara Abdulaziz](https://www.amrop.com/media/4ieky44q/sara-abdulaziz.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=30&height=30&format=auto&quality=30&rnd=132841194632170000)](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/find-a-consultant/profile/sara-abdulaziz)\n\nSara Abdulaziz\n\nSenior Associate\n\n[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/global-offices/Jeddah)\n\nP: [00966507027021](tel:00966507027021)\n\nProperty & Real Estate, Life Sciences, Consumer & Retail, Hospitality & Food Service, Industrial\n\n[![Mahmoud Hijazi](https://www.amrop.com/media/mlcpgcxa/asaad-jamjoom.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=30&height=30&format=auto&quality=30&rnd=132870694104370000)](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/find-a-consultant/profile/mahmoud-hijazi)\n\nMahmoud Hijazi\n\nResearcher\n\n[Jeddah, Saudi Arabia](https://www.amrop.com/global-reach/global-offices/Jeddah)\n\n# Get in touch with our local team\n\n[Contact Jeddah](mailto:info@amrop.sa)\n\nWe use cookies on this site to enhance your user experience\n\nBy clicking any link on this page you are giving your consent for us to set cookies.\n\n[Terms of Use](https://www.amrop.com/terms-of-use/)\n\nOK, I agree",
