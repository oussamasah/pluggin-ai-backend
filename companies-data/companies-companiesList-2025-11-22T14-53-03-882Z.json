Our CEO Jonathan Rowntree was interviewed as part of CNBC’s exploration of innovative alternatives to rare earth dependency. He explained how we offer a fundamentally different path forward:\n\n“Our magnets are made out of iron and nitrogen, which means you can stand up a plant anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe report perfectly captures why the shift from rare earths matters for America's manufacturing resilience and energy independence now more than ever. And, as Gracelin Baskaran, PhD from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) emphasized, making the shift is a fully attainable goal, saying: \"We'll leverage innovation to need less rare earths, and that's one of America's strong points.\"\n\nTake a minute to watch the piece to discover more on why we do what we do at Niron, and how we’re helping to secure vital industries as a result.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/e7Z6cSBF\n\nLink to the full CNBC report in the comments.",

From trade deals to domestic mining activity to investing in innovations like rare-earth-free magnets, all solutions are highlighted in William Booth’s latest piece for The Washington Post.\n\nIn it, Booth dives into the Trump administration’s efforts to tap Greenland’s rare-earth resources as a way to reduce US reliance on China. He also spotlights Niron Magnetics as one of the few companies offering a genuine alternative: high-performance magnets made from iron and nitrogen, no rare earths required.\n\nWe’re proud to be part of a new generation of American manufacturing, helping strengthen domestic supply chains and reimagine what’s possible in magnetics.\n\nFull article linked in the comments.",

Check out some excerpts from the article below. \n\nInventWood has a plan to replace steel with a lighter, stronger, more sustainable material: wood. The company reports its product has a strength-to-weight ratio of up to 10x that of steel and is resistant to fire, weather, and rot. \n\n24M Technologies aims to reduce risks associated with lithium-ion batteries by blocking the collection of metallic structures that build up on the anode surface and can short battery cells and cause fires.  \n\nNiron Magnetics, Inc. has produced the world’s first high-performance permanent magnets made without rare earth minerals, using iron and nitrogen instead. In 2024, Niron entered a purchase agreement to build the first full-scale plant to have the production completed in the U.S., a process that uses 80% recycled water and 97% recycled hydrogen.  \n\nLearn more here and congrats to all winners ⬇️ 🗺️ https://lnkd.in/eZQEnfTQ",

        "description": "Over forty years ago, General Motors invented the neodymium permanent magnet, a breakthrough in materials science that enabled energy efficiency and performance across multiple industries. These high-performance permanent magnets have become a necessity in our daily lives, powering everything from vehicles and medical devices to smartphones and speakers.\n\nToday, these magnets are ubiquitous—yet most people are unaware of the looming supply chain crisis they face. Adamas Intelligence projects global demand for permanent magnets will roughly triple by 2035, and supply chains are struggling to keep pace. With nearly 90% of rare earth magnets produced overseas, we're confronting a technological bottleneck that threatens anything that contains magnets. \n\nAt Niron Magnetics, we've innovated around traditional rare-earth permanent magnet production constraints. Our iron nitride magnet technology represents the next step in permanent magnet development—a high-performance alternative that eliminates rare earth dependencies while maintaining exceptional magnetic properties. By using readily available iron and nitrogen and advanced manufacturing techniques, we're creating iron nitride magnets with zero critical mineral content, superior thermal stability, and a dramatically reduced environmental footprint. \n\nThis year marks an exciting milestone for Niron. We'll break ground on the world's first vertically integrated full-scale manufacturing plant for rare-earth-free powerful permanent magnets in the United States. This facility, located in Sartell, Minnesota, represents a domestic and scalable solution to the growing demand for permanent magnets. By establishing domestic production capabilities, Niron will help reduce the United States’ reliance on foreign sources of magnets and increase our country’s supply chain resilience for critical materials needed for a safe and innovative future.\n\nAs we stand on the shoulders of GM's 1984 breakthrough, we're committed to enabling a more technologically resilient future. The path forward demands all available alternatives, each contributing unique strengths to solving our global permanent magnet challenges. Therefore, the next 40 years of technological innovation will be defined by our ability to scale domestic production of high-performance permanent magnets. \n\nAt Niron, we're not just watching that future unfold—we're actively creating it. Stay tuned for what we accomplish in 2025!",

    "description": "Limiting global warming to 1.5°C implies reaching net zero CO2 emissions in 2050 according to the IPCC. Next to substantially reducing emissions, this target will only be possible by globally deploying carbon removal (CDR) solutions at the scale of billions of tons of CO2. Neustark is a leading provider in this rapidly growing field, having developed a solution to permanently store CO2 from the air in recycled mineral waste such as demolished concrete. \n\nOur first solutions have been deployed in Switzerland and Europe and are already capturing and storing tons of CO2 every week. We are currently scaling up our operations and carbon removal impact globally – on the road to removing one million tons of CO2 in 2030, and beyond that. \n\nFounded in 2019, neustark AG is based in Berne, Switzerland, and is a team of around 55 people (as per Q3 2023) working at our Berne, Zurich and Cologne offices. Together, we enable permanent CO2 storage for a bright future of all generations on our planet.\n\nWhat we do in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joVBNV9O2MA",

        "description": "Last week, we showed you how we at neustark capture our biogenic CO2 at point source. But what happens next? 🔍\n\nTo durably store CO2 in #mineral waste streams, it must be transported from its capture site to a nearby storage site. As transporting air-like gas is not very efficient, a better solution is needed. The answer? We liquefy the CO2 so it fits into our #isotainers 🚚\n\n🐝 Let us show you how that's be(e)ing done...\n\nThink of the CO2 as a swarm of bees, buzzing around at 20 °C and 1 bar. To make it transportable, we #compress the gas, just like bringing the bees closer together. They start buzzing even more, not happy about the increased #density. That's when we have compressed gas at a toasty 80 °C and 16 bar.🌡️\n\nHowever, to make the #CO2 transportable, we have to cool it down again, until it turns into a liquid, reducing its volume even more. Now picture the bees entering their hive, close together and content. Similarly, liquid CO2 is like the bees settled in the hive: compact and ready for transport at -25°C and 16 bar! ❄️",

        "description": "💡 It's time for a quick refresher on how neustark captures CO2 at the source!\n\nTo durably remove #CO2 from the atmosphere, we must first capture it. 🫧 Sounds easy, right? In practice, however, things are not quite so simple. So, let's take a deep dive into neustark's approach to point source capture...\n\nWe work with biogas partners to capture our biogenic CO2. Through a technical process called #biogas upgrading, CO2 gets separated from methane (CO2 makes up ~40-50% of the raw gas). 👨🔬\n \nOur #technology, installed at the existing plant, captures the CO2 offgas directly at its source – instead of releasing it back into the atmosphere. 💨 Due to the upstream processes, it's already vastly pure (~98%). This saves us time and energy vs. filtering CO2 out of the air (with a concentration of ~0,04%).\n\nWe then liquefy the CO2 on site for efficient transport to our nearby #storage plants, where it is permanently removed from the atmosphere! 🔒\n\nEt voilà! That’s how we create decisive #negativeemissions to reach our #netzero goals. 🌎🌱",

And it's these residual emissions we need to address with carbon dioxide removal.\n\n📽️ Watch the video below and find out how we can approach durable #CDR in our TEDxZurich talk. Psst, spoiler alert: by turning the world's largest waste stream, demolition concrete, into a carbon sink – today! 🌏🚀\n\nAnd once again: hats off to Anna for your amazing performance. You rock! 🪨🥳",

        "description": "Last week, we showed you how we at neustark capture our biogenic CO2 at point source. But what happens next? 🔍\n\nTo durably store CO2 in #mineral waste streams, it must be transported from its capture site to a nearby storage site. As transporting air-like gas is not very efficient, a better solution is needed. The answer? We liquefy the CO2 so it fits into our #isotainers 🚚\n\n🐝 Let us show you how that's be(e)ing done...\n\nThink of the CO2 as a swarm of bees, buzzing around at 20 °C and 1 bar. To make it transportable, we #compress the gas, just like bringing the bees closer together. They start buzzing even more, not happy about the increased #density. That's when we have compressed gas at a toasty 80 °C and 16 bar.🌡️\n\nHowever, to make the #CO2 transportable, we have to cool it down again, until it turns into a liquid, reducing its volume even more. Now picture the bees entering their hive, close together and content. Similarly, liquid CO2 is like the bees settled in the hive: compact and ready for transport at -25°C and 16 bar! ❄️",

But there's one key ingredient we can't do without...\n\nAn incredible team bringing our neustark vision to life and removing those tonnes! 🧡\n\nAs always, we kicked off the quarter with our OKR session, aligning company priorities and setting ambitious goals to enable permanent #CO2 storage and removal for a bright future of all generations on our planet. 🌍🌱\n\nOur OKRs are not just about what we do, but also how we do it: as a #team. \n\nWe wrapped up the day by the river, enjoying the summer vibes with our #colleagues from our hubs in Switzerland, France, Poland, Germany and UK. 🥳\n\nThe next day, our new joiners headed out with Kevin Knecht to see our plants in action. There's no better way to understand our tech and #impact than seeing our solution up close! 🚀",

Denn bevor wir CO2 dauerhaft aus der Atmosphäre entfernen können, muss dieser schwebende Tank erst einmal sicher landen. 🫧 \n \n🏗️ Im Rheintal ist genau das passiert: Eine weitere CO2-Speicheranlage ist bei der saw gruppe in Widnau mit dem Kran angekommen – und speichert dort nun täglich CO2 im #Betonrestwasser. \n  \nBis zu 150 Tonnen #CO2 können hier pro Jahr dauerhaft gebunden werden. Nicht schlecht, wenn man bedenkt, dass Betonrestwasser ein Abfallprodukt ist: Es entsteht bei der Reinigung von Betonmischern und enthält einen hohen Anteil an Zementphasen. Genau dort wird durch #Mineralisierung das CO2 dauerhaft gebunden. 🔒 \n   \nDanke an die saw gruppe für die starke Partnerschaft! Wir freuen uns, täglich eine positive #Klimawirkung zu erzielen und unser Netzwerk mit vielen weiteren Partnern zu erweitern.",

In Greenwich, demolition concrete is crushed, filtered and recycled for further use – and also carbonated. \n\n💡How it works: Biogenic #CO2 is captured nearby and transported to the storage site, where it is injected into the recycled aggregate, and – via our accelerated mineralization technology – bound to the pores and surface of the granules. And thus stored permanently, for thousands of years. 🪨 \n\nWith the carbonated recycled concrete aggregate (cRCA), Holcim produces more circular building materials – that also act as a carbon sink!\n\nThis is only the beginning... We are currently expanding our impact across the UK and beyond, scaling our #carbonremoval solution, hand-in-hand with our partners decarbonizing the #construction sector. 🌏\n\n🗞️ Read more here: https://loom.ly/qU1o_4I",

While both play a role in #climate action, businesses will need to prioritize durable solutions. 🔒\n\n③ Steady ramp-up of #carbonremoval: At net-zero, all emissions have to be reduced i.e., neutralized, meaning that reduction and removal efforts have to be progressively ramped up in the next years. 📈\n\nFind out what this means for businesses #netzero goals 👉🏼 https://loom.ly/B03XecY",

Think of photosynthesis: sunlight is needed to turn #CO2 into glucose. 🌱  Just as plants need energy from the sun, endothermic reactions need an input of energy.\n\n🔥 Exothermic reactions release energy. Our #CO2storage process is a perfect example: a plant storing 500 kg of CO2 per hour has an energy release of 550 kW. That would be enough energy to power 45 electric cars cruising at 60 km/h! 🚗 However, since this energy is in the form of low heat (~40°C), it's not easy to make practical use of it.\n\nWhile our process might not heat your office, it’s a powerhouse for our #carbonremoval process. 🔒 Reversing the reaction to release the CO2 again would require the same amount of energy, so >600°C, which is highly unlikely.\n\nneustark's process stores CO2 in mineral waste for thousands of years with a negligible risk of reversal. That's what we call durably capturing, storing and removing CO2 from the atmosphere 💪🌍",
