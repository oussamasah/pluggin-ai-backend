When software tames the chaos and streamlines the little things, it frees you to focus on the big things. Things that amaze. Things that inspire. Things that change the world.\n\nWe're a productive, virtual team that makes productivity tools. We are designers, engineers, and communicators united by a common goal, not a common location.\n\nWe understand the tools our customers need to succeed in today's workplace, because we need them, too. We build them, share them, and use them to power new ideas, new improvements, and new ways of working.\n\nIt's how we've accomplished amazing things, and it's how we help our customers do the same.\n\nDoist's mission is to help people do more each day so they can make the most of their potential.",
