KEEvolution! 2- 10th August!)🚨\n\nOur incredible Head of School, Prof Tim Norman, has (quite sensibly) vanished on a well-earned holiday this afternoon ... and in a bold move, he's left the Deputy Head (Knowledge Exchange & Enterprise) Prof. Sarah M. in charge next week.\n\nA risky move indeed! 🤣 \n\nBecause in her very first act of power, she’s launched a 9-day KEE Takeover .... and yes, things are about to get KEE-riously entertaining!!!\n\nOver the next 9 days, we’ll be unleashing the gloriously geeky world of Knowledge Exchange & Enterprise at ECS: spinouts, start-ups, collaborations, comedy, outreach, dollhouse crime scenes, and a bit of academic revolution.\n\nIt’s fun .... It’s unapologetically KEE!\n\nWill we return control when Tim gets back?\n 🫢...Probably.\n 😈...Maybe.\n 🤖...We’ll get back to you.\n\n#KEETakeover #ECSsouthampton #KnowledgeExchange #KEEriousBusiness #SocialTakeover #InnovationWithIntent\n\nUniversity of Southampton",

ICML starts on Sunday, and I'm happy that my PhD student, Tyler Clark  (co-supervised with Christine Evers), and our collaborator Mark Towers had our work on efficient deep reinforcement learning accepted - Tyler will be presenting \"Beyond The Rainbow: High Performance Deep Reinforcement Learning on a Desktop PC\" in poster session 5 on Thursday 17th.\n\nI'm also really happy that Damian Smith, Harvey Mannering and Antonia Marcu had their work \"Functional Alignment Can Mislead: Examining Model Stitching\" accepted as a spotlight. A lot of work went into this paper, building from Damian and Antonia's previous NeurIPS workshop contribution last year, and I together with rest of the VLC group were pleased to support through \"discussions, feedback, support, snacks, and good fun\" (to quote Antonia!). Damian and Antonia will present in session 4 on Wednesday. \n\nI decided to skip heading back to Vancouver (having already been in December and then racked up airmiles to go to Lukla and trek to Everest Base Camp at Easter), and instead will support the ECS @ UoS team at graduation next Wednesday, where we'll see many of our undergraduate graduands become graduates and also celebrate the successes of many of our PhD students. Over the summer we'll get back to research and the team will be working towards ICLR submissions whilst we wait to hear about NeurIPS. In September the group will be welcoming a bumper crop of new PhD students which is really exciting.",

          "description": "One of the things I love about our approach is that founders don’t feel like they’re facing “trial by investor” when it gets to Demo Day. 🔥\n\nBy the time they’ve got to the pitch, we’ve already helped them stress-test their assumptions, so big questions don’t feel like 'gotcha' moments.\n\nWith Future Worlds Demo Day 25 fast approaching, I’d love to hear from investors in my network…\n\nWhat’s your number one tip for pitching founders?\n\nI’ll start with three of mine…\n\n1. One sentence, right upfront, that tells them what your startup is. Don’t start with a slow-build back story where everyone has to wait a minute for the punchline - investors want to know as soon as possible if you fit within their investment criteria or not.\n\n2. Who’s your customer? What’s their problem? You have to be super clear on why anyone should care about what you’re doing. (And, what evidence do you have to support your claims?)\n\n3. K.I.S.S. - “Keep It Simple, Stupid!” This is especially important in our academic context; a pitch is not a lecture or an academic paper. Time is precious, you can’t explain everything and it’s not about showing how clever you are. Hit the key headlines and let investors ask you questions for the detail they’re interested in.\n\nStartups supported by Future Worlds have raised over £110m as they’ve gone on to change the world. There is huge opportunity to be seized for researchers and students turned startup founders, and for the investors who back them. \n\nI'm really looking forward to witnessing next week's Demo Day pitches from our phenomenal founders. What advice do you have for the founders who will be in front of our investor audience?",

The session was fun, refreshing, and surprisingly insightful — I walked away having learned so much about myself.\n\nThe ECS Science Comedy Academy is a fantastic initiative that helps people build confidence, step out of their comfort zones, and develop skills that are valuable in so many contexts — from public speaking to teaching and beyond.\n\nIf you're ever offered the chance to take part, do it!\n\n#science #comedy #standup #training #fun",
