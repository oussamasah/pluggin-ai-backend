  "reason": "Qashio demonstrates very high intent primarily driven by a recent funding round and the launch of a new product. Although there were no recent signals related to employee onboarding, the funding and product launch provide a strong foundation for growth, despite the absence of a hiring spree or partnerships. The confidence level is slightly decreased because of the recency of the new product launch and the lack of recent employee changes.",
