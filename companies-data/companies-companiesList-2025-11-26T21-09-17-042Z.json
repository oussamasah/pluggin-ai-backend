        "description": "From 800 Dirhams to Billion-Dirham Success: The Power of Never Saying No\n\n27 years ago, Mohamad Abou Zaki made his first sale at Emircom: an 800-dirham modem. His manager called to congratulate him. \"It's only 800 dirhams,\" he said. The reply? \"Still means you can sell.\"\n\nToday, he's #CEO of that same company, generating over a billion dirhams annually with 1,300+ employees across #UAE and #SaudiArabia.\nHis secret? A mindset that built an empire:\n\n🎯 \"I never said no to any task because I wanted to learn\". From sales to logistics to project delivery, M. Abou-Zaki embraced every opportunity. He studied certifications like university coursework, even delivered equipment personally to meet customer commitments.\n🤝 Trust became his competitive advantage. When a customer sent an inflated purchase order, he corrected it downward. That transparency built 20+ year partnerships. \"You need to build your sales around trust,\" he explains.\n💪 Loyalty over opportunism \"Once I select a vendor for a solution, either I win with them or lose with them. I will not change vendors mid-process, even if I lose the business.\" This unwavering commitment earned Cisco partnerships spanning 25 years.\n👨👩👧👦 Family culture drives retention During COVID, while others terminated staff, Emircom hired more people. They provided accommodation and 24/7 support for affected employees. \"We created an environment where employees come to work happily,\" Abou Zaki shares.\n🔮 Strategic vision pays off In 2013, he decided to enter data centers despite not knowing what to do with the first hall. Today, Emircom operates five data center halls and leads sovereign cloud solutions across the region.\n\nThe results speak volumes: Projects delivered in 60 countries, partnerships with global tech giants, and customers who've stayed loyal for decades.\nHis philosophy for aspiring leaders: \"Don't be fascinated with titles. Understand all aspects of the business. Build reputation and trust. Study every customer's unique needs.\"\n\nSometimes the greatest success comes from the humility to start small and the wisdom to never stop learning.What's the most valuable lesson you've learned from saying yes to opportunities outside your comfort zone?\n\n🎙️ Watch the full episode: https://lnkd.in/dpgXchbF \n\n#Leadership #Entrepreneurship #TechInnovation #UAE #BusinessGrowth",

His manager called to congratulate him. \"It's only 800 dirhams,\" he said. The reply? \"Still means you can sell.\"\n\nToday, he's #CEO of that same company, generating over a billion dirhams annually with 1,300+ employees across #UAE and #SaudiArabia.\nHis secret? A mindset that built an empire:\n\n🎯 \"I never said no to any task because I wanted to learn\". From sales to logistics to project delivery, M. Abou-Zaki embraced every opportunity. He studied certifications like university coursework, even delivered equipment personally to meet customer commitments.\n🤝 Trust became his competitive advantage. When a customer sent an inflated purchase order, he corrected it downward. That transparency built 20+ year partnerships. \"You need to build your sales around trust,\" he explains.\n💪 Loyalty over opportunism \"Once I select a vendor for a solution, either I win with them or lose with them. I will not change vendors mid-process, even if I lose the business.\" This unwavering commitment earned Cisco partnerships spanning 25 years.\n👨👩👧👦 Family culture drives retention During COVID, while others terminated staff, Emircom hired more people. They provided accommodation and 24/7 support for affected employees. \"We created an environment where employees come to work happily,\" Abou Zaki shares.\n🔮 Strategic vision pays off In 2013, he decided to enter data centers despite not knowing what to do with the first hall. Today, Emircom operates five data center halls and leads sovereign cloud solutions across the region.\n\nThe results speak volumes: Projects delivered in 60 countries, partnerships with global tech giants, and customers who've stayed loyal for decades.\nHis philosophy for aspiring leaders: \"Don't be fascinated with titles. Understand all aspects of the business. Build reputation and trust. Study every customer's unique needs.\"\n\nSometimes the greatest success comes from the humility to start small and the wisdom to never stop learning.What's the most valuable lesson you've learned from saying yes to opportunities outside your comfort zone?\n\n🎙️ Watch the full episode: https://lnkd.in/dpgXchbF \n\n#Leadership #Entrepreneurship #TechInnovation #UAE #BusinessGrowth",
