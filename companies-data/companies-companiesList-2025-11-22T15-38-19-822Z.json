When software tames the chaos and streamlines the little things, it frees you to focus on the big things. Things that amaze. Things that inspire. Things that change the world.\n\nWe're a productive, virtual team that makes productivity tools. We are designers, engineers, and communicators united by a common goal, not a common location.\n\nWe understand the tools our customers need to succeed in today's workplace, because we need them, too. We build them, share them, and use them to power new ideas, new improvements, and new ways of working.\n\nIt's how we've accomplished amazing things, and it's how we help our customers do the same.\n\nDoist's mission is to help people do more each day so they can make the most of their potential.",

Yes, two App of the Day’s in one month, we’re still pinching ourselves!\n\nOnce again, we wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the millions of people who continue to make us a part of their daily rhythms.

(Sponsored post incoming).\n\nWhen I started my business, I found it almost impossible to keep on top of my inbox, respond to messages, get through all the boring admin that piled up, and then finally get round to writing or filming videos.\n\nThings would slip through the cracks - I’d fill in the wrong form, or miss dinner with my friends, or completely forget to record something my team needed from me. My productivity plummeted, as did my wellbeing - I felt like I was drowning in unfinished tasks and missed responsibilities.\n\nSo, I knew I had to make a change. And the first step was grappling with my to-do list, which was spiralling out of control. I had reminders on post-it notes, in the notes app in my phone, scribbled down in my diary, or at the bottom of Google Docs. It was a total mess.\n\nSo, I decided I wanted to bring together all my tasks and reminders into one place… and after trying dozens of apps, I landed on Todoist. Total gamechanger. Keeping all of my tasks in one digital space meant that I wasn’t constantly trying to flick through notebooks to find what I needed. This helped me get a handle on my tasks, and meant that I wasn’t trying to deal with the mental stress of staying organised while getting things done.\n\nSince then, Todoist has become a key part of my workflow with the team. Now I have an executive assistant - who actually does that full-time job of organising my life - and we can work together with Todoist to quickly and easily get things done. Basically, every time a new task comes up, my assistant adds it to Todoist for me. Perhaps I need to write a social media post by tomorrow - so the task gets added to our shared page with a deadline, so I know to prioritise it.\n\nOr, if I need sign off on something, I can do it right there in the app by responding to any comments or questions without having to jump on a call. If Irem K. (my EA) needs to know if she can go ahead and schedule a podcast interview, or a hang-out sesh with my friends, then I can just answer ‘yep’ asynchronously.\n\nI love that Todoist is built with teams in mind. Keeping my inbox from becoming a complete nightmare isn’t something I can (or want to) do alone, so I’m super lucky to have an assistant (on that note, if you can afford it and it’ll be ROI-positive for you, you should hire one too).\n\nWith the workflows with Irem (and even for solo projects), Todoist is a key part of my productivity stack. If you’re looking for a simple, delightful productivity tool that’ll legit help you do more of what matters to you (and hopefully reduce your stress along the way), you might like to check them out 😁\n\nHere is a walkthrough of my setup: https://lnkd.in/ev5u_Vcv\n\n#Todoist #ProductivityTips",

With years of experience under their belt, they've gained a significant edge in the industry. What sets them apart is not just their knack for attracting top talent, but their skill in keeping them onboard for the long haul.”\n\nJessie de Groot, from Weaviate:\n\"I love the innovative approach from Doist, they truly embrace the remote-first approach with their async way of working, their documentation approach (employee handbook), and hiring people worldwide. What I like about their talent strategy is their transparency (showing their benefits, people on their website), their perks and benefits designed for distributed teams, and the focus on connections sync and async. I believe all of this is the result of executing a great talent strategy.\"\n\nThanks so much for the meaningful words, which will help fuel our team's continuing efforts to make the remote culture at Doist the best it can be. 🙏",

But we also know that building a successful distributed team involves occasionally coming together in the same physical space, to reinforce the connections that support our growth throughout the rest of the year. \n\nMaximizing the effectiveness of those precious few days together takes an intentional plan and a hefty investment, so I'll dive deep into our IRL strategy, and share some internal details that have driven a consistent 95%+ satisfaction rate with our offsite program. \n\nAnd there will be a ton of other great speakers and topics covered for anyone interested in the #futureofwork - I hope you'll join us! \n\nMore info and a 30% discount code available in the comments below, and let me know if you're planning to attend 👇",

(Sponsored post incoming).\n\nWhen I started my business, I found it almost impossible to keep on top of my inbox, respond to messages, get through all the boring admin that piled up, and then finally get round to writing or filming videos.\n\nThings would slip through the cracks - I’d fill in the wrong form, or miss dinner with my friends, or completely forget to record something my team needed from me. My productivity plummeted, as did my wellbeing - I felt like I was drowning in unfinished tasks and missed responsibilities.\n\nSo, I knew I had to make a change. And the first step was grappling with my to-do list, which was spiralling out of control. I had reminders on post-it notes, in the notes app in my phone, scribbled down in my diary, or at the bottom of Google Docs. It was a total mess.\n\nSo, I decided I wanted to bring together all my tasks and reminders into one place… and after trying dozens of apps, I landed on Todoist. Total gamechanger. Keeping all of my tasks in one digital space meant that I wasn’t constantly trying to flick through notebooks to find what I needed. This helped me get a handle on my tasks, and meant that I wasn’t trying to deal with the mental stress of staying organised while getting things done.\n\nSince then, Todoist has become a key part of my workflow with the team. Now I have an executive assistant - who actually does that full-time job of organising my life - and we can work together with Todoist to quickly and easily get things done. Basically, every time a new task comes up, my assistant adds it to Todoist for me. Perhaps I need to write a social media post by tomorrow - so the task gets added to our shared page with a deadline, so I know to prioritise it.\n\nOr, if I need sign off on something, I can do it right there in the app by responding to any comments or questions without having to jump on a call. If Irem K. (my EA) needs to know if she can go ahead and schedule a podcast interview, or a hang-out sesh with my friends, then I can just answer ‘yep’ asynchronously.\n\nI love that Todoist is built with teams in mind. Keeping my inbox from becoming a complete nightmare isn’t something I can (or want to) do alone, so I’m super lucky to have an assistant (on that note, if you can afford it and it’ll be ROI-positive for you, you should hire one too).\n\nWith the workflows with Irem (and even for solo projects), Todoist is a key part of my productivity stack. If you’re looking for a simple, delightful productivity tool that’ll legit help you do more of what matters to you (and hopefully reduce your stress along the way), you might like to check them out 😁\n\nHere is a walkthrough of my setup: https://lnkd.in/ev5u_Vcv\n\n#Todoist #ProductivityTips",

Keeping all of my tasks in one digital space meant that I wasn’t constantly trying to flick through notebooks to find what I needed. This helped me get a handle on my tasks, and meant that I wasn’t trying to deal with the mental stress of staying organised while getting things done.\n\nSince then, Todoist has become a key part of my workflow with the team. Now I have an executive assistant - who actually does that full-time job of organising my life - and we can work together with Todoist to quickly and easily get things done. Basically, every time a new task comes up, my assistant adds it to Todoist for me. Perhaps I need to write a social media post by tomorrow - so the task gets added to our shared page with a deadline, so I know to prioritise it.\n\nOr, if I need sign off on something, I can do it right there in the app by responding to any comments or questions without having to jump on a call. If Irem K. (my EA) needs to know if she can go ahead and schedule a podcast interview, or a hang-out sesh with my friends, then I can just answer ‘yep’ asynchronously.\n\nI love that Todoist is built with teams in mind. Keeping my inbox from becoming a complete nightmare isn’t something I can (or want to) do alone, so I’m super lucky to have an assistant (on that note, if you can afford it and it’ll be ROI-positive for you, you should hire one too).\n\nWith the workflows with Irem (and even for solo projects), Todoist is a key part of my productivity stack. If you’re looking for a simple, delightful productivity tool that’ll legit help you do more of what matters to you (and hopefully reduce your stress along the way), you might like to check them out 😁\n\nHere is a walkthrough of my setup: https://lnkd.in/ev5u_Vcv\n\n#Todoist #ProductivityTips",

(Sponsored post incoming).\n\nWhen I started my business, I found it almost impossible to keep on top of my inbox, respond to messages, get through all the boring admin that piled up, and then finally get round to writing or filming videos.\n\nThings would slip through the cracks - I’d fill in the wrong form, or miss dinner with my friends, or completely forget to record something my team needed from me. My productivity plummeted, as did my wellbeing - I felt like I was drowning in unfinished tasks and missed responsibilities.\n\nSo, I knew I had to make a change. And the first step was grappling with my to-do list, which was spiralling out of control. I had reminders on post-it notes, in the notes app in my phone, scribbled down in my diary, or at the bottom of Google Docs.

Samir A. followed with a sharp demo of how Gatling helps simulate production load and catch performance issues before they hit real users.\n\nAs always, it was great to connect with so many of you. These meetups are all about devs connecting with devs. We also shared updates on the ZurichJS platform, rolled out exclusive community discounts, and gave a peek at what’s coming next.\n\nNot to mention: Nadja Rømer Hesselbjerg officially joined us as a co-organizer two weeks ago and kicked ZurichJS into second gear. There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes work that goes into each event, and she’s already helping us shape an incredibly bright future for where we’re headed.\n\nThanks to Enrique Ruiz Durazo for capturing the night in photos, he’s got an incridble eye for capturing smiles and the unique energy each event brings out. And a huge shout-out to the new volunteers stepping in to help us build what’s next.\n\nWe’re already working hard behind the scenes and are close to locking in the rest of this year’s schedule. The feedback lately has been incredible, and we’ve got some world-class speakers and open source contributors lined up. We’re building a space you’ll want to bring your friends and colleagues to, and make new ones while you’re here.\n\nAnd finally, big thanks to Smallpdf for sponsoring and everyone who supports us through Buy Me a Coffee.

We’re filled with gratitude for the opportunities, challenges, learnings and successes of the past year. None of it would have been possible without the support of our incredible team, users, partners and community. We topped the year off by celebrating together in Zurich during our annual Christmas event!\n\nSome fun facts, in 2024:\n⭐ We processed 800 million documents (read that again!).\n⭐ We launched our new venture ‘Sign.com’.\n⭐ We welcomed 26 new faces in the Smallpdf group.\n⭐ Our team(s) connected over 70 times in real life with team buildings, happiness events, rituals and company days.\n⭐ We got ISO27001 re-certified!\n\nIn 2025, we want to do even better. We’re excited to grow, innovate and make an even greater impact together by bringing you even more powerful features and improved experiences. Our mission remains the same: making working with PDFs simple, accessible, and efficient for everyone.\nFrom all of us at Smallpdf, we wish you a fulfilling 2025 filled with success, productivity, collaboration and new possibilities.

I warned the team I was going to play David Attenborough and grab a photo the next time I walked by while \"class\" was in session. Dre Solorzano taking point to get the team aligned on a domain model decision.\n\nIn-person collaboration is still one of the best tools for teams who are solving challenging problems in complex domains. Our client for this project has been disappointed by other partners in the past. This team's visible progress is a stark difference and I credit this environment as a significant factor in their success. That's on top of each of these teammates being amazingly smart, motivated, and caring deeply about our client's goals.\n\nKeep up the good work, team!",

Get ready for an electrifying episode! 💥\n\nIn this inspiring episode of MeetHER, we dive into the world of tech and empowerment with Brittany Hunter, Delivery Practice Lead at Atomic Object. From a young age, Brittany was captivated by the power of computers as a storytelling tool. As a youth, she discovered her passion for technology by building websites—not just as a technical exercise, but as a creative platform to help people share their most meaningful stories.\n\nThis innate desire to amplify voices through technology set the stage for Brittany's remarkable journey in tech. A true maker at heart, she has always seen computers as more than just machines, but as powerful instruments of connection and expression. \n\nToday, as a Delivery Practice Lead at Atomic, Brittany continues to champion this vision. When she's not horseback riding or exploring her diverse interests, she's working to create inclusive spaces in technology. She opens up about Atomic's Accelerator Program, a groundbreaking initiative designed to build a culture of belonging at Atomic and in the tech industry.\n\nBrittany candidly discusses the challenges women face in technology, including the often-debilitating imposter syndrome and stereotype threat, offering powerful insights on overcoming these barriers. She highlights local organizations like STEM Greenhouse and Girls That Code that are making significant strides in tech diversity.\n\nInspired by Kelly Barnhill's thought-provoking book When Women Were Dragons, this episode is a testament to how a young person's passion for technology can grow into a powerful force for storytelling, connection, and change.\n\nListen Here - 👉 https://lnkd.in/ghiDn2wQ\n\nJoin the movement!
