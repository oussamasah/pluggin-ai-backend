We got the opportunity to show the world what an amazing and modern solution Qashio for Travel is at our launch event at the Royal Atlantis Spa & Resort and to establish our presence at Arabian Travel Market with one of the most visited stands of the whole exhibition.\n\nWhen we started the project in 2022 together with Visa we had a vision to build UAE's first Business Loyalty program and Travel solution for Travel companies as the industry even though massive was severely underserved. We spent years doing research and development, looking at international standards while localizing the solution to serve the needs of the local players in UAE and KSA.  \n\nThe result: \n- Fast growing Loyalty Program with soon more than 10 top tier Airline & Hotel Partners\n- Multicurrency cards (AED, SAR, USD, EUR, GBP) for the travel industry to save money on international transfers\n- High Cashbacks, Rebates and Ultralow FX fee's to support the growing need for cashflow\n\nIt's been an honor to work alongside every single Qashio team member involved in taking the vision to reality and to top it of, the greatest honor and validation of all was for the greatest modern visionary HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum to stop by our stand. \n\nWe look forward to serve and be part of the growth of the Travel Industry in UAE and GCC",

        "description": "Why I choose Deliveroo over talabat and why I shop on Amazon instead of noon.... for one simple reason - to EARN more miles, rewards, and points!\n\nWhether you use credit cards for earning Marriott International Points, Emirates Skywards miles, or other benefits hinges on the \"interchange\" or in other words the commission provided to the card provider by the payment gateway that the merchants use. This commission is determined by the Merchant Category Code (MCC), which is a percentage of the transaction value determined by the category the merchant belongs to.\n\nFor instance, Deliveroo is rightfully categorized as a restaurant, while Talabat is classified as a grocery company despite primarily focusing on aggregating restaurant deliveries and claiming they are a technology company on their Linkedin page. Similarly, Noon, markets itself as an E-commerce or Retail entity (according to their Linkedin page in UAE & KSA) while their MCC carries a grocery status. These companies collaborate with payment gateways to lower fees, resulting in reduced rewards for their customers like miles and cashbacks on credit cards used.\n\nThis practice extends beyond just these examples. To optimize spending and maximize rewards, it's crucial to choose vendors wisely.\n\nBoth Noon & Talabat are otherwise great services and great companies with fantastic individuals leading the organizations employing some of the best talent in the country. I would have used them much more frequently if I would have earned the same rewards on my credit cards as I do when using Deliveroo and Amazon since the cost to me remains the same. \n\nAt Qashio, our Customer Success Management team proactively assists clients in selecting the right vendors to maximize cashbacks, miles, and other rewards without incurring additional costs. We work in alignment with our clients objectives to enhance payment efficiency, minimize expenses and risks, and ensure the highest returns on all expenditures through a unified platform. \n\nLearn more and book a demo https://lnkd.in/dMX6Qguk",
