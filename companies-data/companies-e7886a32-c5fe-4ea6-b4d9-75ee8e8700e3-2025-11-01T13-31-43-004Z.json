And here's why it matters:\n\nUp to 30% of trade spend delivers negative ROI – yet most companies continue to repeat the same plans year after year. -McKinsey-\n\nMore than 60% of consumers are price-sensitive, but only 27% of brands feel confident in their pricing strategy. -EY Future Consumer Index-\n\nCompanies that invest in price pack architecture and trade optimization see, on average, a 3–7% uplift in gross margin.\n\nOur approach to smarter pricing and trade strategy is designed to:\nIdentify pack-price opportunities that drive both volume and value.\nOptimize promotional spend by focusing on real shopper behavior.\nAlign pricing tiers with how shoppers actually buy.\nReduce inefficiencies in trade execution that silently erode profit.\n\nThe result?

(McKinsey & Co.)\n\nAI-driven pricing & promotions can increase revenue by 5-10% while protecting margins. (Harvard Business Review)\n\nMany brands fall into the \"discount trap\"—boosting short-term sales but hurting long-term profitability. The key is strategic, data-driven promotions that drive both volume AND revenue.\n\nHere’s how:\nSet clear objectives – Are you driving trial, retention, or market penetration?\nChoose the right promo mechanics – Not all discounts are created equal!\nLeverage AI-powered insights – Data-driven decisions outperform gut feelings.\nMonitor & optimize in real-time – The best strategies are continuously refined.\n\nBrands using AI-powered pricing outperform competitors by 20%. (BCG)\n\nAt Marketeers, our Smart Value™ platform helps businesses maximize promotions with AI-driven pricing, personalized offers, and real-time insights.\n\nWant to turn promotions into a profit driver?\nLet’s talk! \nhttps://lnkd.in/dhkrNVzU\n\n#Promotions #RevenueGrowth #PricingStrategy #AI #SmartValue #MarketingStrategy #Marketeers",
