The team is now demobilizing, packing up our mobile pilot, removing all equipment, and clearing the site. This is our 6th successful field deployment, spanning brines from salars to oilfields to surface lakes.\n\nPilot operations are a critical step on the path to building a commercial facility on the lake. At the Great Salt Lake, our pilot was designed to: \n\n✅ Prove the tech: Show that Lilac IX can economically recover lithium from some of the toughest, lowest-grade brine out there (70 mg/L Li, 170:1 Mg/Li), with a non-consumptive process that will not lower lake water levels. #anybrineanywhere\n✅ Inform the design: Generate the data needed for FEL-3 engineering.\n✅ Advance permitting: Satisfy regulatory requirements for water and mineral rights to progress key commercial permits.\n✅ Deliver samples: Produce lithium product samples for offtakers and downstream technology providers.\n\nThis has been another successful pilot campaign, and preliminary results are looking strong. Stay tuned for the final results, coming soon! \n\nNow our focus shifts to developing and building the 5,000 tpa LCE commercial lithium facility on the Great Salt Lake.\n\n#criticalminerals #batterymaterials #domesticmanufacturing",

(HSBC Innovation Banking), Raef Sully (Lilac), Sabeeha Islam (Munich Re Ventures), and Tanuj Dutta (Congruent Ventures) for sharing their perspectives on capital formation and risks to be considered across various stages of company lifecycle, as companies progress from early-stage VC to growth and beyond.\n \nSome key takeaways from our discussion included:\n◼️ Climate solutions focused on real/ hard assets require a focus on fundamentals across economic drivers for adoption, margin, and efficiency over hype\n◼️ Focus on incremental gains/ improvements as companies scale their solutions rather than build fast and break model, that doesn’t apply to First commercial scale-up (FOAK). Making a big jump from pilot to FOAK will likely lead to project failure which may be game over for the company\n◼️ Incorporate FOAK planning as early as possible. Spend significant resources on engineering studies upfront with limited design changes once companies start building their pilot or FOAK\n◼️ Apart from providing capital, assess true value proposition of capital providers across VC, CVC, Family Office, Venture Debt early on and then Growth Credit, Equity and Equipment Financing providers as the company scales. Learn to “read the room” based on who you are raising capital from as they all are solving for different outcomes\n◼️ Eventually scaled up companies look more like infrastructure assets so understand what the various steps are to scale and evolve along the way to attract infrastructure capital across debt and equity\n◼️ Institutional investors such as IFM are stepping into 'missing middle' for FOAK financing using novel financing structures such as growth credit loans at corporate level to fund project capital expenditures, thereby acting as a bridge between venture and buyout private equity\n \nFinally, always important to align with investors who have a long track record of achieving both the returns and the broader purpose promised by climate solutions. Grateful to Sidd Bhat, Executive Director at IFM Investors, for moderating a dynamic conversation and to everyone who joined us!",

We’ve produced our first concentrated #lithium sulfate eluate (with a lithium concentration of >10 g/L) from the lake brine. We’re sending the eluate to downstream technology partners and to our HQ in Oakland where it will be refined into battery-grade lithium carbonate.🔋 \n\nThe Lilac field team is testing samples in our on-site lab to demonstrate plant performance including lithium recovery, eluate purity, and brine pH. We’re also working with state agencies and independent 3rd parties to take samples of the lithium-depleted brine to verify Lilac’s non-consumptive and non-contaminating process. This data gathering will also feed into the FEL 3 commercial plant design and engineering.\n\nShout out to our field operations team for their hard work and can-do attitude! 🙌",

    "description": "Limiting global warming to 1.5°C implies reaching net zero CO2 emissions in 2050 according to the IPCC. Next to substantially reducing emissions, this target will only be possible by globally deploying carbon removal (CDR) solutions at the scale of billions of tons of CO2. Neustark is a leading provider in this rapidly growing field, having developed a solution to permanently store CO2 from the air in recycled mineral waste such as demolished concrete. \n\nOur first solutions have been deployed in Switzerland and Europe and are already capturing and storing tons of CO2 every week. We are currently scaling up our operations and carbon removal impact globally – on the road to removing one million tons of CO2 in 2030, and beyond that. \n\nFounded in 2019, neustark AG is based in Berne, Switzerland, and is a team of around 55 people (as per Q3 2023) working at our Berne, Zurich and Cologne offices. Together, we enable permanent CO2 storage for a bright future of all generations on our planet.\n\nWhat we do in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joVBNV9O2MA",

        "description": "Last week, we showed you how we at neustark capture our biogenic CO2 at point source. But what happens next? 🔍\n\nTo durably store CO2 in #mineral waste streams, it must be transported from its capture site to a nearby storage site. As transporting air-like gas is not very efficient, a better solution is needed. The answer? We liquefy the CO2 so it fits into our #isotainers 🚚\n\n🐝 Let us show you how that's be(e)ing done...\n\nThink of the CO2 as a swarm of bees, buzzing around at 20 °C and 1 bar. To make it transportable, we #compress the gas, just like bringing the bees closer together. They start buzzing even more, not happy about the increased #density. That's when we have compressed gas at a toasty 80 °C and 16 bar.🌡️\n\nHowever, to make the #CO2 transportable, we have to cool it down again, until it turns into a liquid, reducing its volume even more. Now picture the bees entering their hive, close together and content. Similarly, liquid CO2 is like the bees settled in the hive: compact and ready for transport at -25°C and 16 bar! ❄️",

        "description": "💡 It's time for a quick refresher on how neustark captures CO2 at the source!\n\nTo durably remove #CO2 from the atmosphere, we must first capture it. 🫧 Sounds easy, right? In practice, however, things are not quite so simple. So, let's take a deep dive into neustark's approach to point source capture...\n\nWe work with biogas partners to capture our biogenic CO2. Through a technical process called #biogas upgrading, CO2 gets separated from methane (CO2 makes up ~40-50% of the raw gas). 👨🔬\n \nOur #technology, installed at the existing plant, captures the CO2 offgas directly at its source – instead of releasing it back into the atmosphere. 💨 Due to the upstream processes, it's already vastly pure (~98%). This saves us time and energy vs. filtering CO2 out of the air (with a concentration of ~0,04%).\n\nWe then liquefy the CO2 on site for efficient transport to our nearby #storage plants, where it is permanently removed from the atmosphere! 🔒\n\nEt voilà! That’s how we create decisive #negativeemissions to reach our #netzero goals. 🌎🌱",

To make it transportable, we #compress the gas, just like bringing the bees closer together. They start buzzing even more, not happy about the increased #density. That's when we have compressed gas at a toasty 80 °C and 16 bar.🌡️\n\nHowever, to make the #CO2 transportable, we have to cool it down again, until it turns into a liquid, reducing its volume even more. Now picture the bees entering their hive, close together and content. Similarly, liquid CO2 is like the bees settled in the hive: compact and ready for transport at -25°C and 16 bar! ❄️",

Denn bevor wir CO2 dauerhaft aus der Atmosphäre entfernen können, muss dieser schwebende Tank erst einmal sicher landen. 🫧 \n \n🏗️ Im Rheintal ist genau das passiert: Eine weitere CO2-Speicheranlage ist bei der saw gruppe in Widnau mit dem Kran angekommen – und speichert dort nun täglich CO2 im #Betonrestwasser. \n  \nBis zu 150 Tonnen #CO2 können hier pro Jahr dauerhaft gebunden werden. Nicht schlecht, wenn man bedenkt, dass Betonrestwasser ein Abfallprodukt ist: Es entsteht bei der Reinigung von Betonmischern und enthält einen hohen Anteil an Zementphasen. Genau dort wird durch #Mineralisierung das CO2 dauerhaft gebunden. 🔒 \n   \nDanke an die saw gruppe für die starke Partnerschaft!

Denn bevor wir CO2 dauerhaft aus der Atmosphäre entfernen können, muss dieser schwebende Tank erst einmal sicher landen. 🫧 \n \n🏗️ Im Rheintal ist genau das passiert: Eine weitere CO2-Speicheranlage ist bei der saw gruppe in Widnau mit dem Kran angekommen – und speichert dort nun täglich CO2 im #Betonrestwasser. \n  \nBis zu 150 Tonnen #CO2 können hier pro Jahr dauerhaft gebunden werden. Nicht schlecht, wenn man bedenkt, dass Betonrestwasser ein Abfallprodukt ist: Es entsteht bei der Reinigung von Betonmischern und enthält einen hohen Anteil an Zementphasen. Genau dort wird durch #Mineralisierung das CO2 dauerhaft gebunden. 🔒 \n   \nDanke an die saw gruppe für die starke Partnerschaft! Wir freuen uns, täglich eine positive #Klimawirkung zu erzielen und unser Netzwerk mit vielen weiteren Partnern zu erweitern.",

In Greenwich, demolition concrete is crushed, filtered and recycled for further use – and also carbonated. \n\n💡How it works: Biogenic #CO2 is captured nearby and transported to the storage site, where it is injected into the recycled aggregate, and – via our accelerated mineralization technology – bound to the pores and surface of the granules. And thus stored permanently, for thousands of years. 🪨 \n\nWith the carbonated recycled concrete aggregate (cRCA), Holcim produces more circular building materials – that also act as a carbon sink!\n\nThis is only the beginning... We are currently expanding our impact across the UK and beyond, scaling our #carbonremoval solution, hand-in-hand with our partners decarbonizing the #construction sector. 🌏\n\n🗞️ Read more here: https://loom.ly/qU1o_4I",

Here's what you need to know about the gold standard for corporate climate targets:\n\n① Reducing and removing: The revised #SBTi standard introduces a framework for integrating emission reductions AND removals simultaneously. 🌱\n\n② Durability matters: SBTi now emphasizes the importance of durable #CDR solutions alongside shorter-lived methods. While both play a role in #climate action, businesses will need to prioritize durable solutions. 🔒\n\n③ Steady ramp-up of #carbonremoval: At net-zero, all emissions have to be reduced i.e., neutralized, meaning that reduction and removal efforts have to be progressively ramped up in the next years. 📈\n\nFind out what this means for businesses #netzero goals 👉🏼 https://loom.ly/B03XecY",

Think of photosynthesis: sunlight is needed to turn #CO2 into glucose. 🌱  Just as plants need energy from the sun, endothermic reactions need an input of energy.\n\n🔥 Exothermic reactions release energy. Our #CO2storage process is a perfect example: a plant storing 500 kg of CO2 per hour has an energy release of 550 kW. That would be enough energy to power 45 electric cars cruising at 60 km/h! 🚗 However, since this energy is in the form of low heat (~40°C), it's not easy to make practical use of it.\n\nWhile our process might not heat your office, it’s a powerhouse for our #carbonremoval process. 🔒 Reversing the reaction to release the CO2 again would require the same amount of energy, so >600°C, which is highly unlikely.\n\nneustark's process stores CO2 in mineral waste for thousands of years with a negligible risk of reversal. That's what we call durably capturing, storing and removing CO2 from the atmosphere 💪🌍",
