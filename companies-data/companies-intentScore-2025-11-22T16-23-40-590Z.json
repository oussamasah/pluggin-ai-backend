  "reason": "Jisr demonstrates a very high intent level due to strong recent signals, particularly the new funding round and new product launch. The company secured $30 million in its Series A funding round, indicating strong growth plans and capital availability. The recent launch of a new product, 'Jisr Spend', suggests increased focus on innovation and adapting to market needs. However, the funding news lacks recent sources, which slightly lowers the overall confidence in this particular signal.",
