While machine learning allows us to identify patterns in vast amounts of data, a key question remains: Can AI also help us understand causal relationships? \n\nProf. Philipp Bach, who was a Postdoc with Prof. Martin Spindler at the University of Hamburg Business School and has been appointed as assistant professor of econometrics at Freie Universität Berlin since July, is exploring this very challenge. His research focuses on whether AI models can recognize and evaluate causes and effects beyond prediction. This is a critical step toward making informed decisions in healthcare, economics, and other fields.\n\nUnderstanding causality is essential for making choices, whether it's selecting the best sport for health or analyzing the impact of policy changes like minimum wage increases. But it’s a complex statistical problem: We often work with sample data and must quantify the uncertainty in our estimates.\n\n🔎 To tackle this, Prof. Spindler’s and Prof. Bach’s team employs advanced approaches like \"double machine learning,\" combining AI’s flexibility with rigorous statistical evaluation. Their work also utilizes cutting-edge hardware and neural network architectures to incorporate text and image data—such as analyzing product descriptions and photos in online shopping—to identify what influences consumer behavior and optimize marketing strategies.\nThis innovative intersection of AI and causal inference has the potential to revolutionize decision-making across various fields.\n\n➡️ Read more about the recognition of causality through AI in our interview:\nhttps://uhh.de/bcter \n\n📸  AI-generated using DALL-E\n\nUniversität Hamburg\n#AI #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning #DoubleMachineLearning #CausalInference #DataScience #UniHamburg",

A recent study led by Levent Uyar from the University of Hamburg Business School uncovers how these devices increase music streaming time and deepen user loyalty to specific streaming services.\n \n📊 Key findings from our representative survey of 1,518 German music listeners show:\n• Users with smart speakers listen to over 20 hours of music weekly — significantly more than non-users (16 hours).\n• 73% of smart speaker owners subscribe to paid music streaming services, compared to just 39% of those without.\n• Device and streaming service ecosystems are closely linked: Amazon Echo users favor Amazon Music Unlimited, Google speaker owners more often use YouTube Music.\n \nLevent Uyar, Research Associate at the Professorship of Marketing & Media under Prof. Michel Clement, adds:\n“Our study results reveal close connections between smart speaker devices and their streaming services. This dynamic raises fascinating questions about ecosystem lock-in, as well as the opportunities and challenges for the global music streaming market.”\n \nAs smart speakers become key platforms for music streaming, they may reshape market competition and influence which content reaches listeners.

The award will be presented each semester by the Management Board across various categories, including compulsory and elective lectures, based on student evaluations.\n \nEach semester, students participate in anonymous evaluations for all courses offered at the Business School using a standardized questionnaire.

At the end of September 2024, she took part in a 6-month research stay at INSEAD in Fontainebleau near Paris. After her return in March, she spoke to us about her experiences.\n\n💫 The most important insights: \n\n1️⃣  The research stay brought many new contacts with professors, doctoral students and postdocs whose heart beats for Academia. \n\n2️⃣  It was interesting to learn more about how she linked her research focus in marketing on individual characteristics and diversity dimensions with her interest in ecolabeling.\n\n3️⃣  As a current research fellow, Julia is supported by a scholarship from the Joachim Herz Stiftung for interdisciplinary business administration, which she used to fund her research stay—an inspiring opportunity that may also be valuable for other early-career researchers and certainly worth exploring.\n\n➡️ Julia's conclusion: \n“I can highly recommend a research stay during or towards the end of the PhD program. It didn’t prolong my studies, as I was able to integrate the project into my dissertation – overall, an incredibly productive, enriching, and worthwhile experience.”\n\n👉 Find the link to the full interview in the first comment. \n\n#BusinessSchoolForTheWorld #ResearchStay",

However, the data on the basis of which the results are generated does not reflect the entire global population equally. Prof. Anne Lauscher and Carolin Holtermann at the University of Hamburg Business School are researching how this leads to distorted representations - and what countermeasures can be taken.\n\n👉 Key findings from their work:\n- The data used to train models often comes from privileged groups and common languages such as English.\n- As a result, less commonly spoken languages and cultures are often completely underrepresented. There are clear biases in the generation of images: Images generated with languages such as Hindi or Finnish reproduce stereotypes or do not show people at all.\n\n 💡 The aim of the research is to develop more inclusive AI models that better represent the diversity of cultures and languages worldwide. Innovative measurement methods will be used to identify systematic weaknesses in order to improve the quality of the data and results.\n\nThe impact of AI on our everyday lives is growing - so it is crucial to make these technologies fair and equitable. \n\n👉 See the first comment for the link to the full interview.\n\n#LLM #AI #ChatGPT #DallE",

Others take the situation with humor and use stickers with the text: “I bought this car before Elon Musk went crazy”. \n\n💬 Overall, Prof. Sattler is certain that Musk's actions will “cause damage to the brand in the short to medium term.” \n \nLinks to the articles in the first comment.\n\n#Tesla #Branding #ElonMusk",

The analysis is based on insights from 207 executives across various industries.\n\nThe study highlights that consumers are increasingly valuing authentic sustainability communication. Companies must recognize this trend and adapt their brand strategies accordingly to minimize switching behavior and build trust.\n\n👉 Thus, brands are not only key to business success but also important players on the path to greater sustainability. \n\n👀 For all details regarding the brand study and the full report, visit the PwC Germany website.

They also learnt that firms need to strategically plan their alliances differently depending on whether they want to patent digital innovations or other innovations.\n\nCongratulations to all authors: Theresa Sophie Bockelmann, PhD, Karl Werder, Jan Recker, Julian Lehmann, Prof. Dr. David Bendig\n\n▶️ Full text of article: https://lnkd.in/ewkjgYHv\n\n📸 UHH/Esfandiari\n#Award #InformationSystems #Alliances #DigitalInnovations",
