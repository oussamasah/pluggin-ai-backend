  "score": 92,
  "reason": "The analysis indicates a very high intent from Unifonic based on strong signals from new funding rounds and consistent prior product launches without recent developments. The funding round shows a robust capital influx, while new product initiatives reflect a strategic direction but lack recent updates to support market traction. Overall, the evidence is well-supported yet slightly older for the new product signal, impacting recency scoring.",
