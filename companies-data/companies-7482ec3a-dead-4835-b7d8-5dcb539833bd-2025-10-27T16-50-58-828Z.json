They insult the past and poorly articulate the WHY.\n \nIf you’re still trying to “push change” from the top, you’re already losing. The organisations that thrive don’t erase their history—they honour it, celebrate it, and then make one courageous leadership decision:\n\n👉 Adapt or slide into irrelevance.\n\nThe Day of Change isn’t just another corporate event. It’s the emotional turning point where leaders acknowledge past victories, publicly commit to a bold future, and hand the microphone to the people who will actually make change happen—the middle of the organisation.\n\nIn this new world, leadership isn’t about control; it’s about trust, empowerment, and immediate action.\n\nCurious how this works in practice? I’ve just published a deep-dive article on how to design and lead a Day of Change that doesn’t just sound inspiring—but creates lasting impact.\n\n🎯 Ready to lead differently?

In disruptive times, it’s actually about letting go—and guiding your team through a dynamic environment with clarity of purpose and trust in their capabilities.\nAre you feeling the turbulence of today’s business world? You’re not alone. But here’s the twist: the most resilient organisations aren’t just “rolling with the punches,” they’re actually steering through them by empowering employees at every level to make decisive moves. When every person understands the mission, and each team has the freedom to adapt quickly, chaos becomes your competitive advantage.\nIn our latest article, we dive into how Auftragstaktik—a centuries-old military philosophy—meshes seamlessly with modern frameworks like Frederic Laloux’s Teal model and Whitewater Reinventions’ Business Reinvention approach.

The secret isn’t a fancy new software—it’s a leadership mindshift toward trust and autonomy.\n\nIn a world filled with constant change, it’s no longer enough to have your best ideas locked away at the top. Organizations that tap into the collective brainpower of every employee are thriving, while those clinging to old-school hierarchies are getting left behind. That’s where intent-based leadership—a concept traced back to military history—enters the picture, revitalized by modern thought leaders like Whitewater Reinventions and the principles of “Business Reinvention.”\nCurious about how giving teams more autonomy can actually increase alignment and results?

Several years ago, I ridiculed myself in front of a former high-ranking NATO officer denouncing military leadership and strategy as outdated and unfit as a playbook for the volatile world of modern business. I was wrong – ‘you don´t know what you don´t know’. \n\nTwo years and significant experiences later, I had to eat my words. Fortunately, the NATO officer accepted my apology. Thank you.\n\nAfter significant, Napoleon-led defeats of the Prussian army in the early 19th century, a deep, structural reform was launched. At the heart: \n- Leading with well communicated intent.\n- Briefing and back-briefing to retain message integrity through the ranks.\n- Decentralized situational leadership and adaptive decision making based on local circumstances.\n- Extensively trained frontline staff versatile in all necessary skills.\n\nThis improved agility and speed leading to significant advantages in situations that developed in unexpected ways. Even Mike Tyson realized: “Everybody has a plan – until they get punched in the face.” Do not let a punch in the face throw you off. Reinvent your organisation.\n#Change #Transformation #Growth",

In 2024, a digital update broke a huge number of their connected speakers. \nHere are some of the results you can expect:\n❌ Furious customers.\n❌ A CEO resignation.\n❌ Competitors gaining market share.\nCustomers don’t care how much you’ve invested in transformation. They care about results.\nA failed transformation can lead to:\n❌ Broken customer experiences and service disruptions.\n❌ Damage to brand reputation and lost trust.\n❌ Competitors stepping in to fill the gap you left.\nIf transformation doesn’t deliver visible, customer-facing wins, it’s just an expensive failure.\nWhat’s the worst transformation failure you’ve seen?\n#CustomerExperience #BrandTrust #TransformationFailure #DigitalInnovation",

Several years ago, I ridiculed myself in front of a former high-ranking NATO officer denouncing military leadership and strategy as outdated and unfit as a playbook for the volatile world of modern business. I was wrong – ‘you don´t know what you don´t know’. \n\nTwo years and significant experiences later, I had to eat my words. Fortunately, the NATO officer accepted my apology. Thank you.\n\nAfter significant, Napoleon-led defeats of the Prussian army in the early 19th century, a deep, structural reform was launched. At the heart: \n- Leading with well communicated intent.\n- Briefing and back-briefing to retain message integrity through the ranks.\n- Decentralized situational leadership and adaptive decision making based on local circumstances.\n- Extensively trained frontline staff versatile in all necessary skills.\n\nThis improved agility and speed leading to significant advantages in situations that developed in unexpected ways. Even Mike Tyson realized: “Everybody has a plan – until they get punched in the face.” Do not let a punch in the face throw you off. Reinvent your organisation.\n#Change #Transformation #Growth",

In disruptive times, it’s actually about letting go—and guiding your team through a dynamic environment with clarity of purpose and trust in their capabilities.\nAre you feeling the turbulence of today’s business world? You’re not alone. But here’s the twist: the most resilient organisations aren’t just “rolling with the punches,” they’re actually steering through them by empowering employees at every level to make decisive moves. When every person understands the mission, and each team has the freedom to adapt quickly, chaos becomes your competitive advantage.\nIn our latest article, we dive into how Auftragstaktik—a centuries-old military philosophy—meshes seamlessly with modern frameworks like Frederic Laloux’s Teal model and Whitewater Reinventions’ Business Reinvention approach.

          "description": "Forget the myth that great leadership is about keeping a firm grip on every detail. In disruptive times, it’s actually about letting go—and guiding your team through a dynamic environment with clarity of purpose and trust in their capabilities.\nAre you feeling the turbulence of today’s business world? You’re not alone. But here’s the twist: the most resilient organisations aren’t just “rolling with the punches,” they’re actually steering through them by empowering employees at every level to make decisive moves. When every person understands the mission, and each team has the freedom to adapt quickly, chaos becomes your competitive advantage.\nIn our latest article, we dive into how Auftragstaktik—a centuries-old military philosophy—meshes seamlessly with modern frameworks like Frederic Laloux’s Teal model and Whitewater Reinventions’ Business Reinvention approach. Intrigued by how decentralization can fuel both innovation and resilience?

          "description": "Ever wonder why some organizations can pivot in a single day while others get stuck in endless meetings and bottlenecks? The secret isn’t a fancy new software—it’s a leadership mindshift toward trust and autonomy.\n\nIn a world filled with constant change, it’s no longer enough to have your best ideas locked away at the top. Organizations that tap into the collective brainpower of every employee are thriving, while those clinging to old-school hierarchies are getting left behind. That’s where intent-based leadership—a concept traced back to military history—enters the picture, revitalized by modern thought leaders like Whitewater Reinventions and the principles of “Business Reinvention.”\nCurious about how giving teams more autonomy can actually increase alignment and results? Check out our latest article, where we unpack the core pillars of trust, clarity, and responsible freedom.

Several years ago, I ridiculed myself in front of a former high-ranking NATO officer denouncing military leadership and strategy as outdated and unfit as a playbook for the volatile world of modern business. I was wrong – ‘you don´t know what you don´t know’. \n\nTwo years and significant experiences later, I had to eat my words. Fortunately, the NATO officer accepted my apology. Thank you.\n\nAfter significant, Napoleon-led defeats of the Prussian army in the early 19th century, a deep, structural reform was launched. At the heart: \n- Leading with well communicated intent.\n- Briefing and back-briefing to retain message integrity through the ranks.\n- Decentralized situational leadership and adaptive decision making based on local circumstances.\n- Extensively trained frontline staff versatile in all necessary skills.\n\nThis improved agility and speed leading to significant advantages in situations that developed in unexpected ways. Even Mike Tyson realized: “Everybody has a plan – until they get punched in the face.” Do not let a punch in the face throw you off. Reinvent your organisation.\n#Change #Transformation #Growth",

          "description": "Forget the myth that great leadership is about keeping a firm grip on every detail. In disruptive times, it’s actually about letting go—and guiding your team through a dynamic environment with clarity of purpose and trust in their capabilities.\nAre you feeling the turbulence of today’s business world? You’re not alone. But here’s the twist: the most resilient organisations aren’t just “rolling with the punches,” they’re actually steering through them by empowering employees at every level to make decisive moves. When every person understands the mission, and each team has the freedom to adapt quickly, chaos becomes your competitive advantage.\nIn our latest article, we dive into how Auftragstaktik—a centuries-old military philosophy—meshes seamlessly with modern frameworks like Frederic Laloux’s Teal model and Whitewater Reinventions’ Business Reinvention approach.

          "description": "What makes reinvention so much more impactful than transformation?\n \nReinvention focuses on what matters most – people and visible outcomes that customers and stakeholders can see. Unlike traditional transformations, reinvention delivers:\n✅ Customer-centric outcomes that boost loyalty and revenue.\n✅ Engaged teams driving innovation and change.\n✅ Bold, measurable results that differentiate your business.\n \nFor example, we helped a $5B FMCG company reinvent their approach. The result? A 15% increase in customer loyalty within one year and significant revenue growth driven by employee-led innovation.\n \nRead more about this case, and what your board needs to know about reinvention ROI, in our latest article.\n \n#BusinessLeadership #Innovation #Reinvention #ROI",
