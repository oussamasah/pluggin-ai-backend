Our Egypt team jumped into a hilarious team-bonding game called The Supermarket, a game that turned a regular workday into a fun reminder of how tricky (and rewarding) communication can be.\n\n➡️ One person steps out\n🗣️ They give a shopping list\n🕵️♀️ The rest of the team? In a room full of noise trying to decode it!\n\nThe result? A lot of yelling, guessing, laughing - and a pretty great lesson: when we take a moment to really listen (even in the noise), we connect better.\n\nBecause being a great team isn’t just about goals and deadlines - it’s about understanding each other, even when the volume’s up.\n\nFarah Omar Farah Amr Mohamed El-Attar Kanzi El Derini Hassan Elsayed Heba El-Maghraby Abdulrahman Ghorab Ahmed Bakr Mahmoud Ahmed el shafey Loloua Besheer Anne Moustafa Dina Ali Safinaz Ahmed Mostafa Esmail Hazem Srour Shimaa safieldein Mohamed Hamdy Abdelrahman Shehata\n\n#TeamCulture #NoiseAwareness #WorkplaceWellness #Collaboration #Grubtech",

Our Egypt team jumped into a hilarious team-bonding game called The Supermarket, a game that turned a regular workday into a fun reminder of how tricky (and rewarding) communication can be.\n\n➡️ One person steps out\n🗣️ They give a shopping list\n🕵️♀️ The rest of the team? In a room full of noise trying to decode it!\n\nThe result? A lot of yelling, guessing, laughing - and a pretty great lesson: when we take a moment to really listen (even in the noise), we connect better.\n\nBecause being a great team isn’t just about goals and deadlines - it’s about understanding each other, even when the volume’s up.\n\nFarah Omar Farah Amr Mohamed El-Attar Kanzi El Derini Hassan Elsayed Heba El-Maghraby Abdulrahman Ghorab Ahmed Bakr Mahmoud Ahmed el shafey Loloua Besheer Anne Moustafa Dina Ali Safinaz Ahmed Mostafa Esmail Hazem Srour Shimaa safieldein Mohamed Hamdy Abdelrahman Shehata\n\n#TeamCulture #NoiseAwareness #WorkplaceWellness #Collaboration #Grubtech",
