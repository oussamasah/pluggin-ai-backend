Hosted by the Leaders of Color Coalition, the program brought together current CA students and alums for an open conversation about how we can continue building a more inclusive, student-centered Concord Academy. We were honored to be joined by Karen McAlmon ’75, a current board member, and Lara Jordan James ’80, a former board member and alum panelist at this year’s Reunion. Their shared insights across generations inspired everyone in the room.\n\nPhotography by Rodolfo Wang ’26",
