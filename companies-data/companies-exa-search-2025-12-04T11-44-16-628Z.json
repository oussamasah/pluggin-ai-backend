This technology is tackling the universal challenge of identity-based attacks holistically, supported by an incident response team with enormous expertise and experience.\n>\n> **General David Petraeus** Semperis Strategic Advisor, U.S. Army (Ret.), former Director of the CIA\n\n> Just as healthcare leaders unite to make groundbreaking discoveries for better medical outcomes, we need to take the same collaborative approach to cybersecurity research and innovation for a safer world. Atrium Health seeks out companies building category-defining solutions that benefit the entire healthcare industry. Semperis is widely adopted in the healthcare sector, with a focus on protecting critical and persistently targeted identity systems, like Active Directory and Entra ID.\n>\n> **Todd Greene** CISO, Advocate Health\n\n> Working at the largest retailer in the world, I was constantly on the cusp of the digital revolution—combating the severe cyber risks it introduced, while still enabling the business to harness its transformative power. As a strategic advisor to Semperis, I’m excited to continue this mission by helping companies in the retail sector and beyond to be more cyber resilient so they can embrace the future, not fear it.\n>\n> **Kerry Kilker** Semperis Strategic Advisor, Former CISO Walmart\n\n> Active Directory is the ‘Achilles’ heel’ for enterprise security programs. Semperis is offering a timely solution considering that AD has been at the center of many widespread and business-crippling attacks in recent years.\n>\n> **Christina Richmond** Program Vice President, Security Services at IDC\n\n> Semperis is a mission-driven company uniquely positioned to not only help organizations prevent costly downtime, but also to curb the funding of evil. When organizations can say ‘no’ to blackmail and ransom demands, we’re all safer.\n>\n> **Ed Amoroso** Founder and CEO at TAG Cyber\n\n> Enterprises too frequently underestimate the importance of Active Directory security and recovery. Enterprises are learning the hard way that if ransomware takes AD down, the entire business goes down with it. Semperis came to market with solutions and service offerings that dramatically increase the operational resiliency of organizations everywhere, starting with the core identity system, AD. I’m proud to be part of the mission and join the industry’s most skilled collection of AD security experts.\n>\n> **Simon Hodgkinson** Former CISO at bp\n\n## If Active Directory isn’t secure, nothing is\n\nOver 80% of all breaches involve credential abuse\n\nSystemic weakness make AD a soft target\n\n​Cloud identity stores extend from AD\n\nZero trust model assumes AD integrity\n\n## AI-powered Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR) for hybrid AD environments\n\nSemperis provides the industry’s most comprehensive hybrid Active Directory threat prevention, detection, response, and recovery.
