Neustark turns this waste stream into a carbon sink. We’ve created and deployed a solution that binds CO2 in demolished concrete aggregate through mineralization – thus permanently storing it and removing the CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\nWe work with biogas plants to source our CO2, concrete recyclers to store the CO2, and companies with ambitious climate strategies on their journey to net zero, who acquire our CDR (carbon dioxide removal) credits.\n\nIn a nutshell: we permanently remove CO2 and thus generate negative emissions.\n\nWe are currently scaling up across the globe – on our way to removing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of CO2 in this decade, and beyond that.\n\n## Get to know us, our team and our technology\n\nWatch Video\n\n## Who we work with\n\n### Construction & demolition waste recyclers\n\nWe partner with you to pioneer a new field. Our technology is embedded at your site – alongside your existing business model and operations. Our partnership helps you to optimize your baseline.\n\n[How can we partner up?](https://www.neustark.com/en/recyclers-concrete-construction-materials)\n\n### CO2 sources\n\nWe partner with you to valorize your CO2 emission volumes, today. This helps you to generate additional income, helps us to capture CO2 to permanently store – and, ultimately, helps the climate.\n\n[Why should we join forces?](https://www.neustark.com/en/co2-sources)\n\n### Businesses with climate targets\n\nWe help you to achieve your net zero climate strategy by removing your hard to abate emissions. Neustark’s carbon removal (CDR) is permanent, verified, and measurable.\n\n[Let's take climate action together!](https://www.neustark.com/en/businesses-with-climate-targets)\n\n## The process\n\n## Why we do it\n\nBy removing CO2from the atmosphere and storing it in demolition concrete permanently, neustark's technology generates negative emissions.\n\nReducing the emissions we produce across the globe is crucial – but to reach our climate goals, carbon removal is also indispensable.\n\nFor a bright future of all generations on our planet.\n\n[Why carbon removal is important](https://www.neustark.com/en/our-mission-negative-emissions-for-net-zero)\n\n## How we do it\n\nNeustark captures, transports and stores CO2 by working with source (e.g. biogas plants) and storage (i.e. concrete recyclers) partners located in close proximity to each other.\n\nOur mineralization technology binds the CO2 in demolished concrete, thus removing it permanently.\n\nBusinesses at the forefront of climate action buy our CDR, which, alongside their reduction efforts, helps them to achieve net-zero.\n\nIt’s a win-win-win for our partners and clients, and ultimately and most importantly, the planet and all generations.\n\n[This is how it works](https://www.neustark.com/en/our-solution-mineralization)\n\n> **We enable permanent CO2 storage** – for a bright future of all generations on our planet.\n\n## Our network of trusted partners, clients, and organizations\n\n## Latest news\n\nBlog\n\n03.09.25\n12 min read\n\n### London’s iconic Skyline could be the secret formula to unlock Construction’s circular economy in the UK\n\nUsing the world’s largest waste stream - demolition concrete - as a carbon sink offers a transformative solution to lock away residual CO2 within new buildings.\n\nFind out more\n\nPress release\n\n26.08.25\n7 min read\n\n### Neustark and Swiss sign multi-year carbon removal agreement\n\nSWISS becomes neustark’s first CDR partner from the aviation industry.\n\nFind out more\n\nCase Studies\n\n13.08.25\n9 min read\n\n### Practical application in Berlin shows: carbonated recycled concrete is in no way inferior to conventional concrete\n\nThe Friedenauer Höhe is the first large residential construction project where carbonated recycled concrete has been used.\n\nFind out more\n\n## Interested in connecting with us at neustark?\n\n[Contact us today](https://www.neustark.com/en/get-in-touch)",

Next to substantially reducing emissions, this target will only be possible by globally deploying carbon removal (CDR) solutions at the scale of billions of tons of CO2. Neustark is a leading provider in this rapidly growing field, having developed a solution to permanently store CO2 from the air in recycled mineral waste such as demolished concrete. \n\nOur first solutions have been deployed in Switzerland and Europe and are already capturing and storing tons of CO2 every week. We are currently scaling up our operations and carbon removal impact globally – on the road to removing one million tons of CO2 in 2030, and beyond that. \n\nFounded in 2019, neustark AG is based in Berne, Switzerland, and is a team of around 55 people (as per Q3 2023) working at our Berne, Zurich and Cologne offices. Together, we enable permanent CO2 storage for a bright future of all generations on our planet.\n\nWhat we do in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joVBNV9O2MA",
