This source is authoritative and recent. While the internal company profile also lists a range of \"201‑500 employees,\" it additionally reports a current headcount of 90, which appears to be an inconsistency; however, the range provided matches the criterion. Other sources (ZoomInfo reports 51‑200, Crunchbase does not specify employees) do not contradict the LinkedIn range. Given the most authoritative and recent evidence, the company meets the employee‑count requirement.",
