  "score": 54,
  "reason": "The overall score reflects a moderate intent due to the presence of a high-impact signal regarding new partnerships, although no evidence was found for critical signals like new office openings and sales department expansion. While the partnership signal shows some viability with four related sources, its recency and the lower average confidence dampen the overall intent. There are indications of potential momentum, but the lack of diversified signals reduces strength.",
