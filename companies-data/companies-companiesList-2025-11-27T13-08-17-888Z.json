No AI, no slides, just real perspective that resonated with many. Samir A. followed with a sharp demo of how Gatling helps simulate production load and catch performance issues before they hit real users.\n\nAs always, it was great to connect with so many of you. These meetups are all about devs connecting with devs. We also shared updates on the ZurichJS platform, rolled out exclusive community discounts, and gave a peek at what’s coming next.\n\nNot to mention: Nadja Rømer Hesselbjerg officially joined us as a co-organizer two weeks ago and kicked ZurichJS into second gear. There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes work that goes into each event, and she’s already helping us shape an incredibly bright future for where we’re headed.\n\nThanks to Enrique Ruiz Durazo for capturing the night in photos, he’s got an incridble eye for capturing smiles and the unique energy each event brings out. And a huge shout-out to the new volunteers stepping in to help us build what’s next.\n\nWe’re already working hard behind the scenes and are close to locking in the rest of this year’s schedule. The feedback lately has been incredible, and we’ve got some world-class speakers and open source contributors lined up. We’re building a space you’ll want to bring your friends and colleagues to, and make new ones while you’re here.\n\nAnd finally, big thanks to Smallpdf for sponsoring and everyone who supports us through Buy Me a Coffee. You help keep this all running ❤️\n\nMore to come.\n\nLinks in the comments 👇\n\n#ZurichJS #JavaScriptCommunity #FrontendDev #MeetupRecap #WebDevelopment #ZurichTech",

No AI, no slides, just real perspective that resonated with many. Samir A. followed with a sharp demo of how Gatling helps simulate production load and catch performance issues before they hit real users.\n\nAs always, it was great to connect with so many of you. These meetups are all about devs connecting with devs. We also shared updates on the ZurichJS platform, rolled out exclusive community discounts, and gave a peek at what’s coming next.\n\nNot to mention: Nadja Rømer Hesselbjerg officially joined us as a co-organizer two weeks ago and kicked ZurichJS into second gear. There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes work that goes into each event, and she’s already helping us shape an incredibly bright future for where we’re headed.\n\nThanks to Enrique Ruiz Durazo for capturing the night in photos, he’s got an incridble eye for capturing smiles and the unique energy each event brings out. And a huge shout-out to the new volunteers stepping in to help us build what’s next.\n\nWe’re already working hard behind the scenes and are close to locking in the rest of this year’s schedule. The feedback lately has been incredible, and we’ve got some world-class speakers and open source contributors lined up. We’re building a space you’ll want to bring your friends and colleagues to, and make new ones while you’re here.\n\nAnd finally, big thanks to Smallpdf for sponsoring and everyone who supports us through Buy Me a Coffee. You help keep this all running ❤️\n\nMore to come.\n\nLinks in the comments 👇\n\n#ZurichJS #JavaScriptCommunity #FrontendDev #MeetupRecap #WebDevelopment #ZurichTech",
