  "score": 65,
  "reason": "Menaitech displays high intent largely due to a strong signal from a new product launch, albeit there are no recent signals regarding funding, partnerships, or hiring activities. The product launch indicates proactive business efforts, although the absence of other signals limits the overall intent score. Recency is also a factor since no new signals have emerged in the last 90 days.",
