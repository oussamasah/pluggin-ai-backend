Lots of friendly competition, plenty of laughs, and let’s just say… some swings were more stylish than effective. We also joined forces with our friends at HD for a park cleanup to help give back to our local parks.\n \nMay – Members of the PBA team spent time volunteering with Habitat for Humanity of Omaha, gaining hands-on experience in homebuilding while supporting a great cause. It was both humbling and inspiring. Our golfers also teed off at the Griffin Golf Classic in support of Gretna East High School Booster Clubs.\n \nJune – We proudly sponsored and participated in the Bike With Mike mental health fundraiser. A fun and rainy day of biking, connecting, and of course, celebrating with some well-earned tacos! Our team hit the greens again for a great cause at the Goodwill Golf Tournament, proudly participating as event sponsors and enjoying a day of golf in support of Goodwill’s impactful programs.\n \nJuly – Summer fun continues with our sand volleyball league! This week we celebrated our first win of the season!\n \nWe’re proud of the work we do every day, but even more proud of the team we’ve built and the ways we support our community together.\n \n#PercipioBusinessAdvisors #CommunityMatters #TeamCulture #GivingBack #HabitatForHumanity #BikeWithMike #GriffinGolfClassic #SandVolleyball #LifeAtPBA",

Lots of friendly competition, plenty of laughs, and let’s just say… some swings were more stylish than effective. We also joined forces with our friends at HD for a park cleanup to help give back to our local parks.\n \nMay – Members of the PBA team spent time volunteering with Habitat for Humanity of Omaha, gaining hands-on experience in homebuilding while supporting a great cause. It was both humbling and inspiring. Our golfers also teed off at the Griffin Golf Classic in support of Gretna East High School Booster Clubs.\n \nJune – We proudly sponsored and participated in the Bike With Mike mental health fundraiser. A fun and rainy day of biking, connecting, and of course, celebrating with some well-earned tacos! Our team hit the greens again for a great cause at the Goodwill Golf Tournament, proudly participating as event sponsors and enjoying a day of golf in support of Goodwill’s impactful programs.\n \nJuly – Summer fun continues with our sand volleyball league! This week we celebrated our first win of the season!\n \nWe’re proud of the work we do every day, but even more proud of the team we’ve built and the ways we support our community together.\n \n#PercipioBusinessAdvisors #CommunityMatters #TeamCulture #GivingBack #HabitatForHumanity #BikeWithMike #GriffinGolfClassic #SandVolleyball #LifeAtPBA",
