But it should be simpler. From opening a business account to accepting payments to getting financing, we’re here to support you at every step.\nThis film is a tribute to the people we serve, the doers, the dreamers, the ones who wake up every day to build something of their own. \n\nIt’s a reminder of why we show up: because when small businesses thrive, everything around them thrives too.\n\nThank you for being on this journey with us. We’re just getting started. 🚀",

When this podcast first started, it was just a couch, a mic, and a vague idea of the direction of travel. Today, it’s become a platform where some of the sharpest minds in banking, fintech, web3, venture, technology, and beyond come together to decode the future of finance and technology. \n\nBut none of it — none — would be possible without the incredible companies who’ve chosen to back this journey from Day 1 (and we are now in our 4th season with over a 130 episodes publised)\n\n💥 To our returning sponsors — Adyen Thunes and Mastercard — thank you for believing in this platform again. Your continued support means more than you know. \n\n🙌 And to the new partners joining the ride — e&, HALA, SC Ventures by Standard Chartered, and Digit9 — welcome to the Couchonomics crew. Thrilled to have you onboard as we level up the conversations and expand the ecosystem across the region and beyond.\n\nWith a new look studio, a bolder editorial agenda, and some truly iconic guests already lined up, Season 4 is shaping up to be our most ambitious yet.\n\nThank you for the trust, the belief, and the company.

When this podcast first started, it was just a couch, a mic, and a vague idea of the direction of travel. Today, it’s become a platform where some of the sharpest minds in banking, fintech, web3, venture, technology, and beyond come together to decode the future of finance and technology. \n\nBut none of it — none — would be possible without the incredible companies who’ve chosen to back this journey from Day 1 (and we are now in our 4th season with over a 130 episodes publised)\n\n💥 To our returning sponsors — Adyen Thunes and Mastercard — thank you for believing in this platform again. Your continued support means more than you know. \n\n🙌 And to the new partners joining the ride — e&, HALA, SC Ventures by Standard Chartered, and Digit9 — welcome to the Couchonomics crew. Thrilled to have you onboard as we level up the conversations and expand the ecosystem across the region and beyond.\n\nWith a new look studio, a bolder editorial agenda, and some truly iconic guests already lined up, Season 4 is shaping up to be our most ambitious yet.\n\nThank you for the trust, the belief, and the company. Let’s build something remarkable — together🎙️ \n\n#Couchonomics #FutureOfFinance #PodcastLaunch #Season4 #Gratitude #Fintech #Innovation #DigitalEconomy #DigitalBanking #digitalassets #MiddleEastInnovation #FintechPodcast #FutureOfFinance",
