We are designers, engineers, and communicators united by a common goal, not a common location.\n\nWe understand the tools our customers need to succeed in today's workplace, because we need them, too. We build them, share them, and use them to power new ideas, new improvements, and new ways of working.\n\nIt's how we've accomplished amazing things, and it's how we help our customers do the same.\n\nDoist's mission is to help people do more each day so they can make the most of their potential.",

(Sponsored post incoming).\n\nWhen I started my business, I found it almost impossible to keep on top of my inbox, respond to messages, get through all the boring admin that piled up, and then finally get round to writing or filming videos.\n\nThings would slip through the cracks - I’d fill in the wrong form, or miss dinner with my friends, or completely forget to record something my team needed from me. My productivity plummeted, as did my wellbeing - I felt like I was drowning in unfinished tasks and missed responsibilities.\n\nSo, I knew I had to make a change. And the first step was grappling with my to-do list, which was spiralling out of control. I had reminders on post-it notes, in the notes app in my phone, scribbled down in my diary, or at the bottom of Google Docs. It was a total mess.\n\nSo, I decided I wanted to bring together all my tasks and reminders into one place… and after trying dozens of apps, I landed on Todoist. Total gamechanger. Keeping all of my tasks in one digital space meant that I wasn’t constantly trying to flick through notebooks to find what I needed. This helped me get a handle on my tasks, and meant that I wasn’t trying to deal with the mental stress of staying organised while getting things done.\n\nSince then, Todoist has become a key part of my workflow with the team. Now I have an executive assistant - who actually does that full-time job of organising my life - and we can work together with Todoist to quickly and easily get things done. Basically, every time a new task comes up, my assistant adds it to Todoist for me. Perhaps I need to write a social media post by tomorrow - so the task gets added to our shared page with a deadline, so I know to prioritise it.\n\nOr, if I need sign off on something, I can do it right there in the app by responding to any comments or questions without having to jump on a call. If Irem K. (my EA) needs to know if she can go ahead and schedule a podcast interview, or a hang-out sesh with my friends, then I can just answer ‘yep’ asynchronously.\n\nI love that Todoist is built with teams in mind. Keeping my inbox from becoming a complete nightmare isn’t something I can (or want to) do alone, so I’m super lucky to have an assistant (on that note, if you can afford it and it’ll be ROI-positive for you, you should hire one too).\n\nWith the workflows with Irem (and even for solo projects), Todoist is a key part of my productivity stack. If you’re looking for a simple, delightful productivity tool that’ll legit help you do more of what matters to you (and hopefully reduce your stress along the way), you might like to check them out 😁\n\nHere is a walkthrough of my setup: https://lnkd.in/ev5u_Vcv\n\n#Todoist #ProductivityTips",

(Sponsored post incoming).\n\nWhen I started my business, I found it almost impossible to keep on top of my inbox, respond to messages, get through all the boring admin that piled up, and then finally get round to writing or filming videos.\n\nThings would slip through the cracks - I’d fill in the wrong form, or miss dinner with my friends, or completely forget to record something my team needed from me. My productivity plummeted, as did my wellbeing - I felt like I was drowning in unfinished tasks and missed responsibilities.\n\nSo, I knew I had to make a change. And the first step was grappling with my to-do list, which was spiralling out of control. I had reminders on post-it notes, in the notes app in my phone, scribbled down in my diary, or at the bottom of Google Docs. It was a total mess.\n\nSo, I decided I wanted to bring together all my tasks and reminders into one place… and after trying dozens of apps, I landed on Todoist. Total gamechanger. Keeping all of my tasks in one digital space meant that I wasn’t constantly trying to flick through notebooks to find what I needed. This helped me get a handle on my tasks, and meant that I wasn’t trying to deal with the mental stress of staying organised while getting things done.\n\nSince then, Todoist has become a key part of my workflow with the team. Now I have an executive assistant - who actually does that full-time job of organising my life - and we can work together with Todoist to quickly and easily get things done. Basically, every time a new task comes up, my assistant adds it to Todoist for me. Perhaps I need to write a social media post by tomorrow - so the task gets added to our shared page with a deadline, so I know to prioritise it.\n\nOr, if I need sign off on something, I can do it right there in the app by responding to any comments or questions without having to jump on a call. If Irem K. (my EA) needs to know if she can go ahead and schedule a podcast interview, or a hang-out sesh with my friends, then I can just answer ‘yep’ asynchronously.\n\nI love that Todoist is built with teams in mind. Keeping my inbox from becoming a complete nightmare isn’t something I can (or want to) do alone, so I’m super lucky to have an assistant (on that note, if you can afford it and it’ll be ROI-positive for you, you should hire one too).\n\nWith the workflows with Irem (and even for solo projects), Todoist is a key part of my productivity stack. If you’re looking for a simple, delightful productivity tool that’ll legit help you do more of what matters to you (and hopefully reduce your stress along the way), you might like to check them out 😁\n\nHere is a walkthrough of my setup: https://lnkd.in/ev5u_Vcv\n\n#Todoist #ProductivityTips",

But we also know that building a successful distributed team involves occasionally coming together in the same physical space, to reinforce the connections that support our growth throughout the rest of the year. \n\nMaximizing the effectiveness of those precious few days together takes an intentional plan and a hefty investment, so I'll dive deep into our IRL strategy, and share some internal details that have driven a consistent 95%+ satisfaction rate with our offsite program. \n\nAnd there will be a ton of other great speakers and topics covered for anyone interested in the #futureofwork - I hope you'll join us! \n\nMore info and a 30% discount code available in the comments below, and let me know if you're planning to attend 👇",

If Irem K. (my EA) needs to know if she can go ahead and schedule a podcast interview, or a hang-out sesh with my friends, then I can just answer ‘yep’ asynchronously.\n\nI love that Todoist is built with teams in mind. Keeping my inbox from becoming a complete nightmare isn’t something I can (or want to) do alone, so I’m super lucky to have an assistant (on that note, if you can afford it and it’ll be ROI-positive for you, you should hire one too).\n\nWith the workflows with Irem (and even for solo projects), Todoist is a key part of my productivity stack. If you’re looking for a simple, delightful productivity tool that’ll legit help you do more of what matters to you (and hopefully reduce your stress along the way), you might like to check them out 😁\n\nHere is a walkthrough of my setup: https://lnkd.in/ev5u_Vcv\n\n#Todoist #ProductivityTips",

But we also know that building a successful distributed team involves occasionally coming together in the same physical space, to reinforce the connections that support our growth throughout the rest of the year. \n\nMaximizing the effectiveness of those precious few days together takes an intentional plan and a hefty investment, so I'll dive deep into our IRL strategy, and share some internal details that have driven a consistent 95%+ satisfaction rate with our offsite program. \n\nAnd there will be a ton of other great speakers and topics covered for anyone interested in the #futureofwork - I hope you'll join us! \n\nMore info and a 30% discount code available in the comments below, and let me know if you're planning to attend 👇",
