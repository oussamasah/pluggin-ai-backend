  "score": 100,
  "reason": "Rewaa shows very high intent driven by strong signals from a recent funding round and a newly launched product program. The funding round signals significant capital availability while the new product launch suggests strategic growth and infrastructure needs. The evidence quality is robust, especially with the new funding round, which had numerous sources. However, the product launch has less evidence overall, bringing the score slightly down.",
