Our CEO Jonathan Rowntree was interviewed as part of CNBC’s exploration of innovative alternatives to rare earth dependency. He explained how we offer a fundamentally different path forward:\n\n“Our magnets are made out of iron and nitrogen, which means you can stand up a plant anywhere in the world.”\n\nThe report perfectly captures why the shift from rare earths matters for America's manufacturing resilience and energy independence now more than ever. And, as Gracelin Baskaran, PhD from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) emphasized, making the shift is a fully attainable goal, saying: \"We'll leverage innovation to need less rare earths, and that's one of America's strong points.\"\n\nTake a minute to watch the piece to discover more on why we do what we do at Niron, and how we’re helping to secure vital industries as a result.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/e7Z6cSBF\n\nLink to the full CNBC report in the comments.",

Check out some excerpts from the article below. \n\nInventWood has a plan to replace steel with a lighter, stronger, more sustainable material: wood. The company reports its product has a strength-to-weight ratio of up to 10x that of steel and is resistant to fire, weather, and rot. \n\n24M Technologies aims to reduce risks associated with lithium-ion batteries by blocking the collection of metallic structures that build up on the anode surface and can short battery cells and cause fires.  \n\nNiron Magnetics, Inc. has produced the world’s first high-performance permanent magnets made without rare earth minerals, using iron and nitrogen instead. In 2024, Niron entered a purchase agreement to build the first full-scale plant to have the production completed in the U.S., a process that uses 80% recycled water and 97% recycled hydrogen.  \n\nLearn more here and congrats to all winners ⬇️ 🗺️ https://lnkd.in/eZQEnfTQ",

These high-performance permanent magnets have become a necessity in our daily lives, powering everything from vehicles and medical devices to smartphones and speakers.\n\nToday, these magnets are ubiquitous—yet most people are unaware of the looming supply chain crisis they face. Adamas Intelligence projects global demand for permanent magnets will roughly triple by 2035, and supply chains are struggling to keep pace. With nearly 90% of rare earth magnets produced overseas, we're confronting a technological bottleneck that threatens anything that contains magnets. \n\nAt Niron Magnetics, we've innovated around traditional rare-earth permanent magnet production constraints. Our iron nitride magnet technology represents the next step in permanent magnet development—a high-performance alternative that eliminates rare earth dependencies while maintaining exceptional magnetic properties. By using readily available iron and nitrogen and advanced manufacturing techniques, we're creating iron nitride magnets with zero critical mineral content, superior thermal stability, and a dramatically reduced environmental footprint. \n\nThis year marks an exciting milestone for Niron. We'll break ground on the world's first vertically integrated full-scale manufacturing plant for rare-earth-free powerful permanent magnets in the United States. This facility, located in Sartell, Minnesota, represents a domestic and scalable solution to the growing demand for permanent magnets. By establishing domestic production capabilities, Niron will help reduce the United States’ reliance on foreign sources of magnets and increase our country’s supply chain resilience for critical materials needed for a safe and innovative future.\n\nAs we stand on the shoulders of GM's 1984 breakthrough, we're committed to enabling a more technologically resilient future. The path forward demands all available alternatives, each contributing unique strengths to solving our global permanent magnet challenges. Therefore, the next 40 years of technological innovation will be defined by our ability to scale domestic production of high-performance permanent magnets. \n\nAt Niron, we're not just watching that future unfold—we're actively creating it. Stay tuned for what we accomplish in 2025!",

A gigawatt-scale fusion plant might consume only enough fuel annually to fit in a pickup truck bed.\n\nAnd while fusion may sound like science fiction, the technology has steadily advanced for decades. From the first H-bombs of the 1950s to the National Ignition Facility's achievement of a fully ignited plasma, the foundation is there. Now, companies like Xcimer are applying modern engineering approaches to bring commercial fusion within reach.\n\n📹 Watch Schrep’s conversation with Xcimer Energy Corporation cofounders Connor and Alexander about how fusion can meet growing energy demands while eliminating emissions.",

        "reshared_post_description": "Fusion energy represents one of the most promising paths to abundant, clean power generation - using fuel that could fit in a pickup truck to generate what would otherwise require mile-long trains of coal. 🛻 ⚡\n\n\"When fusion plants are finally deployed worldwide, you will essentially be manufacturing energy as opposed to drilling for it,\" explains Xcimer's Cofounder and CEO Conner Galloway. \"There's millennia of supply of these fuels in the Earth's crust and oceans, making it the ultimate energy source.”\n\nThe advantages: No high-level radioactive waste, minimal land use, and incredibly efficient fuel consumption. A gigawatt-scale fusion plant might consume only enough fuel annually to fit in a pickup truck bed.\n\nAnd while fusion may sound like science fiction, the technology has steadily advanced for decades. From the first H-bombs of the 1950s to the National Ignition Facility's achievement of a fully ignited plasma, the foundation is there. Now, companies like Xcimer are applying modern engineering approaches to bring commercial fusion within reach.\n\n📹 Watch Schrep’s conversation with Xcimer Energy Corporation cofounders Connor and Alexander about how fusion can meet growing energy demands while eliminating emissions.",

The Henry Adams Curve charts two centuries of American progress, with a steady 2-3% annual growth in energy use that got us everything from steam engines to jet aircraft.\n\nBut by the 1970s, that progress stalled as the environmental costs of fossil fuels became impossible to ignore. Without a clear alternative energy source, human advancement hit a wall.\n\nAt Los Alamos National Lab, Xcimer Energy Corporation founders Conner Galloway and Alexander Valys learned about a way forward. Their insight built on three overlooked breakthroughs:\n\n1️⃣ Proving Fusion Ignition (1980s)\n\nThe Halite-Centurion program proved fusion works with a large-enough fuel pellet, but replicating the results with a 10 megajoule laser as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences was too expensive.\n\n2️⃣ High-Energy Lasers for Missile Defense (1980s)\n\nSignificant defense program R&D advanced low-cost, high-energy excimer lasers, but the systems were shelved after the Cold War ended.\n\n3️⃣ Laser Pulse Compression (1970s)\n\nSoviet researchers developed Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS), a technique to shorten laser pulses, but the work drew little attention in the West.\n\nFast forward, and today Xcimer aims to make fusion power—the same process that fuels stars—commercially viable. \"With fusion, we're manufacturing energy instead of drilling for it,\" says Galloway.\n\nA gigawatt fusion plant runs on fuel that fits in a pickup truck. No more mile-long coal trains. The raw materials are simple deuterium from water and lithium from Earth's crust. Enough exists to power human civilization for thousands of years.\n\nToday, the team at their Denver Phoenix facility is working to prove this vision. Their prototype will merge forgotten Cold War breakthroughs and government research with modern engineering advances to create a more affordable and scalable fusion system.\n\nWe published a complete profile on what Conner and Alexander are building at Xcimer.

On the heels of our $100 million Series A raise, we have more exciting news to share - last week we signed our award agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE) in the Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program. \n\nWe’re one of just eight companies selected by DOE to receive funding for meeting milestones in the first 18 months of a five-year program for private-sector-led teams to develop comprehensive designs for a fusion pilot plant. Our CEO, Conner Galloway and VP of Chamber and Plant Design, Susana Reyes were on-site at the White House to mark this momentous event.\n\nWe’re now on the cusp of harnessing the potential of fusion energy to bring this power source to the world. To get there, forging public-private partnerships will be instrumental. We can’t wait to roll up our sleeves and get to work. \n\nRead more about the program here: https://lnkd.in/ewrVyjdZ\n\n#fusionenergy",
