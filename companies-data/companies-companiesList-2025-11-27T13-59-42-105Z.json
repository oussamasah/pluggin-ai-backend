Scalable products, where exports are competitive but commercially underleveraged.\n3. Near-competitive products, where exports have a high-return opportunity but are on the cusp of competitiveness.\n\nWithin the core-competitive product base, plastics, organic chemicals, and fertilizers generate over 70% of potential revenues.

By treating data as an enduring asset, aligning compute with enterprise needs, and embedding interoperable analytics across functions, leaders can build the foundations that turn GenAI from hype into sustainable impact.

        "description": "Nearly $600 billion in disrupted trade flows is redrawing the global sourcing map. Much of this turmoil stems from the shifting dynamics between the world’s two largest economies. An asymmetry in trade reliance—where the U.S. depends heavily on Chinese imports, while China sources most of its imports from other countries—has magnified the consequences of trade barriers. Between 2022 and 2024, the U.S. consistently sourced 14–17% of its imports from China, while China obtained over 93% of its imports from non-U.S. suppliers. \n\nThis reshaping of global supply and demand patterns has opened new spaces for countries ready to step in. Saudi Arabia can expand its role as a competitive exporter in categories where U.S. dependency is high and diversification is overdue—particularly plastics, fertilizers, and chemicals.\n \nPolicymakers and exporters have an opportunity to take strategic action on several fronts: target high-dependency sectors in the U.S. import basket where substitution is both necessary and viable; accelerate trade facilitation measures to ease access to the market; align domestic production strategies with emerging demand patterns; and invest in reliability, quality standards, and compliance infrastructure to position Saudi products as default alternatives in disrupted supply chains.  \n\nThe full findings are available in our latest report on post-tariff trade dynamics: https://lnkd.in/gSxXrQKZ",

        "description": "Saudi Arabia’s hospitality sector has experienced wide swings in FDI over the past seven years, but those shifts reveal how reform, not just recovery, drives investor confidence.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2021, the sector faced significant volatility. Accommodation and food service activities saw net FDI outflows of –$201M (2017) and –$316M (2021), while AER recorded –$50M (2019) and –$94M (2021). These patterns reflect a period of institutional uncertainty, compounded by the pandemic.\n\nBut by 2022, that trend reversed.\n\nFDI into accommodation and food service rebounded to $164M, while AER recovered to $65M. The turnaround follows key structural reforms—new tourism licensing systems, streamlined FDI procedures, and clearer regulatory oversight under Vision 2030.\n\nThis momentum aligns with national targets: the Hospitality Investments Enablers program aims to attract $11B in FDI and create 120,000 jobs by 2030.\n\nFor stakeholders, the message is clear: consistent reform and institutional transparency are prerequisites for durable investment flows.\n\nRead the full analysis here: https://lnkd.in/g2xgiwWx",

Actual exports to China are $9.8 billion, with an untapped potential of $7.6 billion; and export levels to the U.S., which currently hover between $2 billion and $3 billion, have the potential to almost double.\n\nThese gaps signal markets where demand exists, Saudi products are competitive, and access is viable, but supply has not yet scaled to match.\nTo close the gaps, coordinated efforts from policy and business leaders are required. Two key actions carry high return: one, adapting products to meet the packaging, labeling, and regulatory and consumer expectations of target markets, and two, strengthening market intelligence capabilities to be prepared for any shifts in demand, policy, and competitor activity.\n\nFor more details, see the full report https://lnkd.in/eryvFxmn",

In broader categories like textiles, China also supplied more than half of total imports. These are everyday goods deeply embedded in consumer markets. And yet, they represent some of the most concentrated supply chains in the world. \n\nAs tensions between the U.S. and China reshape trade policy, brands and retailers are facing a dual challenge: ensuring cost stability and maintaining continuity of supply. \n\nOur latest analysis reveals that entire product categories—ranging from apparel and plastics to furniture and household items—are exposed to sudden shifts in sourcing risk, with limited supplier diversity.\n\nResponding to this moment demands a forward-looking approach: mapping dependencies, rebalancing supplier portfolios, and identifying viable alternatives before disruption hits. \n\nTo stay resilient, companies must adjust their supply chain architectures before the next shock arrives.\n\nExplore the full report and our actionable insights here: https://lnkd.in/gSxXrQKZ",

        "description": "While much attention is paid to the U.S. dependency on Chinese imports, the inverse relationship reveals a different kind of strategic insight. In 2024, China’s top imports from the U.S. included aircraft, medical devices, oil seeds, chemicals, and optical instruments. But in most of these categories, the U.S. share remained below 10%, with one key exception: aircraft, where nearly half of China’s imports came from American manufacturers.\n\nThe pattern suggests that China has already diversified many of its critical supply channels and that U.S. influence remains concentrated in a few high-value categories. However, these are limited in number and increasingly shaped by geopolitical dynamics.\n\nFor businesses in other markets, the implications are clear. Competing in China—or supporting exporters who do—requires precision targeting in sectors where reputation, regulation, or quality set firms apart. There is space for new entrants, but success will depend less on volume and more on offering capabilities that are not easily replaced.\n\nExplore the data and implications in our latest report: https://lnkd.in/gSxXrQKZ",

Electrical equipment alone accounted for more than $127 billion in import value, while industrial machinery contributed another $85 billion. These sectors support large parts of the U.S. economy—from infrastructure and energy to manufacturing and defense.\n\nBut the data also points to a different kind of vulnerability. Some of the highest dependency levels appear in everyday goods. More than 90 percent of U.S. umbrellas, 78 percent of feathers and decor, and nearly three-quarters of toys and games were sourced from China. These categories are embedded in high-turnover supply chains.\n\nBy plotting import value alongside dependency, our analysis reveals an uneven risk profile. Businesses are exposed in high-value areas, as well as in overlooked categories with limited sourcing options.\n\nCompanies need to reassess where they are most exposed—not just in terms of value. Prioritizing flexibility in sourcing, especially for categories with high dependency and limited substitutes, can preserve continuity.\n\nRead the full breakdown: https://lnkd.in/gSxXrQKZ",
