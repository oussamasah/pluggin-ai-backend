  "reason": "The analysis revealed a mix of signals with some strengths but significant limitations, particularly in terms of evidence quality and recency. The most impactful signal was the funding round, which indicated capital availability, but the associated evidence was from low-confidence sources released several months ago. The employee joining signal provided minimal evidence and low confidence, while no new product evidence was found, which downgrades intent significantly. Overall, despite the funding signal, the lack of recent and robust data prevents a higher intent score.",
