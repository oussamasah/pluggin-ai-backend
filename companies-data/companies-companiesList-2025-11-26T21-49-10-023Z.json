The turmoil of 2023 taught us many lessons on building and maintaining a proper culture in financial institutions. Keeping with the theme of financial turmoil in 2023, I also led a discussion of new liquidity measurement / monitoring dynamics and consumer behaviors in the era social media. \n\nThe GCC has a young, tech-savvy, and values-driven population that needs special attention in building brand recognition and maintaining brand loyalty. This is now even more of a challenge in the era of social media, Fintech competition, and digital transformation. We are now seeing emergence and maturity of digital assets and tokenization as serious competition as well. All of this of course affects how a bank manages its liquidity needs, which also ties back to maintaining a proper corporate culture. \n\nAlready looking forward to the Fourth Edition of this increasingly valuable forum! \n\nGrant Thornton - UAE Grant Thornton (US) Fawad Omer Başak Yetişen Teker Prasanna Seshachellam Rodrigue Abi El Hesn Dr Nasreen Al Qaseer Rabih Nehme Mohamed Daoud Mohamad El Khalil Ayman Khalifa Tayma Radhi Nayef Abdulrahman, CFA, MBA Stephen J.

This marks a significant step in the UAE’s digital tax transformation journey, aligning with global best practices and driving real-time tax transparency.\n\nAt Grant Thornton UAE, we break down what this means for businesses:\n- Phased implementation based on turnover, starting with a pilot in July 2026 and mandatory adoption for large businesses from January 2027.\n- ERP and accounting systems must be upgraded to generate structured e-invoices and comply with new data and reporting standards.\n- Master data and transaction flows should be validated now to ensure readiness and avoid last-minute challenges.\n- Appointment of Accredited Service Providers (ASPs) is mandatory - businesses should plan early to integrate systems and ensure compliance.\n\nOur latest article covers:\n- The legal foundations and regulatory milestones\n- The detailed transition timeline and who is affected\n- Practical steps for compliance and how to turn this mandate into a strategic advantage\n\n🔗 Read the full article: https://lnkd.in/dJcDt-js \n\nImran Mushtaq, PhD | Kabir Dhawan | Gouban Gopalakrishnan | Harsh Bhatia | Norina Dsouza | Radhika Bhargava \n\n#GTUAE #EInvoicing #VAT #TaxAdvisory #DigitalTransformation",
