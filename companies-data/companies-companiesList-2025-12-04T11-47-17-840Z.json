        "description": "[PT] Hoje aconteceu a primeira sessão do nosso Partner Sales Enablement, direto do Hub da VTEX , reunindo nossos parceiros estratégicos para uma imersão nas novidades e oportunidades do nosso ecossistema.\n\nFalamos sobre as novas capacidades de Inteligência Artificial da Jitterbit — com os AI Assistants e AI Agents — e também sobre as condições especiais para nossos parceiros.\n\nA integração via iPaaS continua sendo essencial para evitar o famoso “spaghetti web” de sistemas — mas agora vai além: é também a base para garantir governança e sucesso na adoção dos Agentes de IA.\n\nUm dado que chama atenção: mais de 80% dos projetos de IA falham por falta de uma estratégia sólida. As empresas que iniciam essa jornada com uma arquitetura escalável e integrada saem na frente — e é exatamente isso que nossos parceiros estão construindo conosco.\n\nObrigada pelo apoio de hoje Rodolfo Flaire e Débora Brito e também por toda a contribuição Thiago Gonçalves Anderson Marques de Sousa  Caio Luis Cardilli Picinini Elias Ramos  \n\nFicamos muito felizes com a troca de hoje e com o engajamento de todos que estão crescendo junto conosco nessa jornada de inovação.\n\nDanielli Alves Welington Patzsch Pablo Canano Carlos Oliveira Roberto Vietri  Jaison Ruppel Renato Avelar Alexandre Bonati Filipe Chuster  JE Escobar Caio Costa  e todos os demais que entraram online \n\n#Parceria #Inovação #IA #PartnerSalesEnablement #VTEX #Ecossistema #InteligenciaArtificial\n\n[EN] 🚀 Today we held the first session of our Partner Sales Enablement, live from the VTEX Hub, bringing together our strategic partners for an immersive experience full of updates and new opportunities within our ecosystem.\nWe explored Jitterbit’s new Artificial Intelligence capabilities — including AI Assistants and AI Agents — and shared special conditions designed for our partners.\n\nIntegration through iPaaS remains essential to avoid the well-known “spaghetti web” of disconnected systems — but now it goes even further: it’s also the foundation for ensuring governance and success in adopting AI Agents.\nHere’s a striking fact: over 80% of AI projects fail due to a lack of a solid strategy. Companies that begin their AI journey with a scalable and integrated architecture are already several steps ahead — and that’s exactly what our partners are building with us.\n\nA huge thank you to Rodolfo Flaire and Débora Brito for their support today, and to Thiago Gonçalves, Anderson Marques de Sousa, Caio Luis Cardilli Picinini, and Elias Ramos for all their valuable contributions.\n\nWe’re thrilled with today’s discussions and the engagement of everyone who is growing with us on this exciting journey of innovation.\n\n#Partnership #Innovation #AI #PartnerSalesEnablement #Jitterbit #Ecosystem",

        "description": "🚀 Should You Build a Migration Tool to Attract Users from a Competitor? 🤔\n\nThis is a common question in product and growth discussions — and the answer isn’t always straightforward.\n\nHere’s how I think about it:\n\n✅ It’s worth building when:\n\t•\tYou’re strategically targeting a competitor’s user base and want to reduce friction in switching.\n\t•\tYour product offers clear differentiation and long-term value.\n\t•\tBuilding, managing, and maintaining the tool is cost-efficient relative to the revenue it generates.\n\t•\tThe potential customer lifetime value justifies the upfront investment.\n\t•\tYou’re targeting a segment with low technical expertise — like small businesses — who need a simple path to move over.\n\n❌ It’s likely not worth it when:\n\t•\tThe tool requires a heavy engineering investment with lots of edge cases.\n\t•\tThe conversion potential is uncertain, or customers are reluctant to switch.\n\t•\tYou’re dealing with technically sophisticated users who may prefer flexibility or custom solutions over automation.\n\t•\tYour product is still maturing — focus on the core experience first.\n\t•\tYou’re unsure whether the potential revenue truly justifies the cost of building, managing, and maintaining the migration tool.\n\n🔍 It also depends on:\n\t•\tHow complex and expensive the tool is to build.\n\t•\tHow much potential really exists to convince users to move.\n\t•\tThe type of customer you’re targeting. If they lack expertise, automation adds value. If they’re advanced users, the ROI of a migration layer may be low.\n\n💡 Takeaway: Before writing code, weigh the strategic value, technical lift, and actual switching intent. In many cases, starting with lightweight manual support or onboarding services can help you test demand before committing to full-scale tooling.\n\n#productstrategy #growth #customeracquisition #saas #tech #startups #b2b",
