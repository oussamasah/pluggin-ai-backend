I didn’t know much about it — just that it talked about intersections, innovation, and how great ideas often come from the most unexpected combinations. I read it cover to cover. \nSomething about it just stuck with me. \n\nRecently, I picked it up again — this time to go deeper and apply the concepts more intentionally. It felt timely. It felt necessary.\n\nAnd today…\nI got to meet Frans Johansson — the person who wrote that book and sparked that shift in me all those years ago. A full-circle moment I never saw coming.\nWe had such a meaningful conversation. I’m so grateful he made time despite a packed schedule. \n\nI walked away happy and energized- With a big smile.\nAnd yes, he signed my book: “See you at the intersection.”\nStill smiling 😁 \n\nBy the way — the book came out 21 years ago. And yet, it still feels like it was written for today. That’s what happens when something is rooted in first principles — it just keeps staying relevant.\n\n#TheMediciEffect #Innovation #Creativity #IntersectionalThinking #FransJohansson #Leadership #Gratitude #BooksThatChangeYou",
