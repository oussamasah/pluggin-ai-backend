Once you have an agreement with Armin he sticks to it with rigor and creates an environment of trust. This means that in a Vendor/Partner type of relationship we do not have to worry about any games being played one against the other.\n\nOn a business development level Armin is a very creative person who can find opportunities where others see only obstacles. His proactivity is infectious and he can get people together from multiple companies and create a team who can make an impact in a chosen market place. \n\nIn summary, I would not hesitate to trust my business with Armin. He gets results.”",

    "summary": "You may think marketing is just making videos, and you're right (just that, you're 10% right). Hi, Im Aish, and welcome to a quick write-up on what Marketing really is. Every brand has a product/service to offer, and marketers make sure that no matter what stage your customer is in (there are four main ones Awareness- Interest- Desire- Action), there is a way to rope them in closer towards a sale. We are sales enablement, we represent every initiative taken to make the brand really known for what it is. So, if your customers walk in fully aware of what it is that you do, you are welcome! With nearly 10 years of growing businesses in profit thanks to various digital marketing and traditional marketing strategies, I love everything about this function and my goal has always been to increase brand value through various marketing initiatives. Done it all, from - Running brand partnerships - Drafting compelling social media activity and engagement - Hosting and participating in events that increases brand awareness and product interest - Building creative copy across all channels- digital and physical - Ensuring websites are optimized for highest lead conversion - Using performance marketing to drive business growth For fun, I use a lot of my marketing skills to build a voice on Linkedin and Instagram. The personal play truly allows me to meet like-minded professionals and understand algorithms better. Hopefully by the end of this read, you figure out the other sides to marketing. If not, I invite you to a drop me a DM and ask me what I'm currently working on and you may just about get a better picture!",
