  "reason": "Emircom currently exhibits minimal intent based on the available signals. The analysis revealed one strong signal from an older partnership with Cisco, but no recent activity related to new offices or department expansions. The reliance on outdated information significantly lowers the overall intent score. The average confidence level remains low due to the quality of the evidence being poor across the board.",
