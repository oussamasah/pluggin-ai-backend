  "score": 76,
  "reason": "The analysis reveals strong intent from Qashio primarily through the new funding round signal, which has the highest possible score of 100. The recent funding activity indicates substantial financial backing and potential growth. However, the lack of recent sources for new product launches and a single older signal regarding employee addition lowers the overall score due to diminished evidence recency. The high confidence in the funding round contrasts with the moderate confidence in other signals. Overall, while Qashio exhibits strong intent, the dependencies on recent signals and evidence quality suggest a slightly lower score than before.",
