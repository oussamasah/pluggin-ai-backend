Small to large organizations, including many of the Am Law 100 firms, rely on NetDocuments’ modern, secure solution for intelligent and confidential document and email management. With decades of document management experience, NetDocuments continually enhances the application, providing customer firms the most innovative solution for document and email management available in the market today. By eliminating on-premises or hosted system hardware and moving into the security of the cloud, the IT burden is dramatically decreased, reducing the cost and complexity of the DMS.\n\nNo other cloud-based document management solution is more secure than NetDocuments. Data security and strict digital asset protection are key differentiators of the service that allow law firms and other industries with strict compliance and security guidelines to confidently store and collaborate on their documents and email. Additionally, our powerful integrations with Microsoft Office allow for smart editing, drafting, searching, and version control. Extranets, secure links, and client portals provide collaboration and security to outside parties who need real time access to their documents.\n\nThe pillars of our service include mobility, secure collaboration, disaster recovery, and compliance, and our SaaS (subscription-as-a-service) model requires us to proactively engage with our customers, ensuring we are meeting stringent requirements on a day-to-day basis. This includes managing a robust network for technical support and communities to share knowledge and insight regarding best practices.",
